## Some confusing cases (Under construction)

### Attribute or Entertain

Entertain mainly concerns the writer's own views while attribute is a way to use external voice to present their views.
To differentiate these two, one clear differences is the subject of the communication/mental verb. That is, `who` believes/thinks/argue etc.
If the subject of that sentence is a third person (or external informational source), we consider it as an attribution to an external source.
If the subject of the sentence is related to the author themselves (e.g., I, this paper, etc.), we consider it as an ENTERTAIN move.

- _I **believe (ENTERTAIN)**_ that the government should ...
- I **argue (ENTERTAIN)** that ....
- _Some group of people **believe (ATTRIBUTE)**_ that the government should ...
- Some findings **indicate (ATTRIBUTE)** that ...
- A majority of people **answered (ATTRIBUTE)** that ....

### Pronounce or Entertain
The main difference between pronounce and entertain is whether the utterance allows for dialogic alternatives. Entertain move allows for alternative interpretations or voices by expressing possibilities. Pronounce move, on the other hand, challenges and dismiss an alternative views (contraction). 
- I am **convinced (ENTERTAIN)** that ... :
- I **contend (PRONOUNCE)** that ...


### Endorse or Attribute
The main difference between endorse and attribute concerns the degree of authors approval of the content of the external sources. In ENDORSE, the author refers to the external source and show their alignment to the idea in order to advance their argument and contract the dialogic space. On the other hand, the main rhetorical effect of ATTRIBUTE is more neutral; the author simply make reference to an external sources. 
- The result **demonstrated (ENDORSE)** that ...
- The author **mentioned (ATTRIBUTE)** that ...

When the writer use communication verbs (argue, state, explain) with intensification to align with that view (e.g., rightly, effectively), then they are ENDORSE.
- The author **convincingly argued (ENDORSE)** that ...
- The paper **rightly pointed (ENDORSE)** out that ....

### Modal verbs with permissions/obligations are considered as ENTERTAIN
- You **must** switch off the lights when you leave.
- 

### Attribute or Monogloss
In some cases, communication verb is used to talk about the action itself, not attributing the content of the locution.
Test this by substituting the communication/mental verb with `state/argue` or `think`. If you can find appropriate substitution with basic communication verbs that can function as ATTRIBUTE, then it is likely that the move is also ATTRIBUTE.

- Then, she spoke (MONOGLOSS) to the public. (The focus is on the *action* of speaking, not the content.) 
- Some **say (ATTRIBUTE)** it's cool. (The focus is on the content [AND who says it].)
- They **observed** that the change in the emotion was temporary. (Substitution to `stated/argued` still makes sense, so it is likely to be an ATTRIBUTE.)
- They observed a rare star. (Substitution to `stated/argued` gives you strange sentence, they are description of the action, not the content.)


### Rhetorical questions
Rhetorical questions can have two functions, each corresponding either `Entertain` or `Concur`.

1. A rhetorical question functions as `Entertain` when it introduces "a proposition in such a way that it is presented as but one of a number of possible positions" (White, 2003, p. 267).
2. A rhetorical question functions as `Concur` when it presents "proposition as so self-evident or agreed upon that it doesn’t actually need to be stated by the textual voice, it can be left up to the reader to supply the required meaning." (White, 2003, p. 267)


Rhetorical questions categorized as `Entertain` include following examples:
- **So what brings happiness to our life? (ENTERTAIN)** (Tip: Tag the entire question.)

Rhetorical questions categorized as `Concur` include following:
- **Should we go to war against these children? (CONCUR)** (Tip: Tag the entire question.)


## Multiple engagement resources in a T-unit
Often times, we will find multiple engagement resources in a single unit (T-unit). 
- **As the name implies (ATTRIBUTE)** _it **seemed (ENTERTAIN)**_ as if eating children was one of the main focuses of anti-witch writings.
- **Even (COUNTER)** **if repenting (ENTERTAIN)**, the person **could (ENTERTAIN)** still be deceived by the devil again, and **would (ENTERTAIN)** return as a threat.
- Output in the English language class **may (ENTERTAIN)** **not (DENY)** always be a productive or necessary use of classroom time
- **Though (COUNTER)** these ideas **may (ENTERTAIN)** **not (DENY)** be driving educational policy, they are inﬂuencing attitudes in ways that have the potential to affect outcomes.


## Some typical engagement patterns (Under construction)

### Entertain + Deny ( + maximizer)
`Maximizer` includes adverbs such as *always*, *severely*, etc.
- Output in the English language class **may (ENTERTAIN)** **not (DENY)** **always (MAXIMIZER)** be a productive or necessary use of classroom time

### Deny + Entertain ( + maximiser)
- **Not (DENY)** to do so **may (ENTERTAIN)** **severely (MAXIMIZER)** weaken the ﬁndings of both.
