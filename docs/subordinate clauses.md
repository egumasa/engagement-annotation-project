# (Under construction)
# Engagement in subordinate clauses

Subordinate clause are tricky because the functions of them are sometimes distinct from their structural patterns.
This page will describe some of the key patterns of interaction between structural characteristics and `engagement`.


## Grammatical description of subordinate clauses
From the grammatical perspective, subordinate clauses can be classified into several categories.
Each deserve separate attention in the current documentation. Note there may be a correlation between structural patterns and `engagement` this is never absolute. 
Remember that `engagement` is (discourse) semantic categories.

### Verb + (that-)clause
This pattern typically occurs when clausal complement (such as that-clause) follows mental or communication verbs.

- The author argued _that television has helped to shrink the relative distance between people and countries_.
- I think _Mary teaches French_.
- It appears _that maximum price fixing does the greatest harm when set below a competitive level_.


### Noun + (that-)clause
This patterns occurs when a (that-)clause elaborates content of the noun expression. 

- _The idea that the company has a clear responsibility to the incident_ was rejected by the judge.
- Their argument was based on _the belief that a happy ending is a certainty_.
- Our conclusion is drawn based on _the fact that there was a correlation between the intensifier use and their perception of social identity_.


### Adverbial clauses
Adverbial clause can add `condition`, `time`, `reason`, etc. to the main clause.

- _Because the steps are made of a smooth, polished—and therefore slippery—stone_, the BTA should’ve taken precautions to clean the steps in such wintry conditions.
- _Although some medical ethicists claim that cloning will lead to designer children (R. Miller 12)_, others note that the advantages for medical research outweigh this consideration (A. Miller 46).
- _While the Supreme Court rejected the “quality of care” argument in the federation case_, the oligopolistic characteristics and purchasing structure of insurance make this outcome unsurprising.

### Relative clauses
A relative clause is where a clause is used to modify a noun (antecedent). There are two main categories in the use of relative clause.

The first type of relative clause occures when a noun is modified by a whole clause. It is typically used to identify which noun they are talking about out of all the possible cases of the noun.
- The analysis should be regarded as _a tool which alerts us to the potential conflicts_.

The other type of relative clause typically elaborates the content of the whole clause or introduces additional information about the noun expression/whole clause.

- We included all participants into the analysis with the exception of _the Italian participants, which was necessary to control for their native languages._

# General guideline for engagement tagging in an subordinate clause
(TBU)

## Tagging engagement in Adverbial clauses

Engagement resources in the adverial clauses should be tagged.
