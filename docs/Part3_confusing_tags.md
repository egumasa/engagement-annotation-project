## Some confusing cases (Under construction)

### Pronounce or Entertain
The main difference between pronounce and entertain is whether the utterance allows for dialogic alternatives. Entertain move allows for alternative interpretations or voices by expressing possibilities. Pronounce move, on the other hand, challenges and dismiss an alternative views (contraction). 
- I am **convinced (ENTERTAIN)** that ... :
- I **contend (PRONOUNCE)** that ...


### Endorse or Attribute
The main difference between endorse and attribute concerns the degree of authors approval of the content of the external sources. In ENDORSE, the author refers to the external source and show their alignment to the idea in order to advance their argument and contract the dialogic space. On the other hand, the main rhetorical effect of ATTRIBUTE is more neutral; the author simply make reference to an external sources. 
- The result **demonstrated (ENDORSE)** that ...
- The author **mentioned (ATTRIBUTE)** that ...

### Modal verbs with permissions/obligations are considered as ENTERTAIN

- You **must** switch off the lights when you leave.

## Multiple engagement resources in a T-unit
Often times, we will find multiple engagement resources in a single unit (T-unit). 
- **As the name implies (ATTRIBUTE)** **it seemed (ENTERTAIN)** as if eating children was one of the main focuses of anti-witch writings.
- **Even (COUNTER)** **if repenting (ENTERTAIN)**, the person **could (ENTERTAIN)** still be deceived by the devil again, and **would (ENTERTAIN)** return as a threat.
- Output in the English language class **may (ENTERTAIN)** **not (DENY)** always be a productive or necessary use of classroom time
- **Though (COUNTER)** these ideas **may (ENTERTAIN)** **not (DENY)** be driving educational policy, they are inﬂuencing attitudes in ways that have the potential to affect outcomes.
