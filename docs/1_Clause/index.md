# Clause boundary detection 

In this step, you will segment the running text into sentences and clauses. 
Clause boundary detection aims to help you think about the overall structure of the sentence before tagging any engagement values.


{: .note }
Since this is a auxiliary task, we do not really do full-fledged clausal analysis, such as non-finite clauses as modifier of nouns, etc.. Thus, the following guideline is not intended to conduct a full clausal analysis, but abbrebiated version that helps us during the engagement annotation.


## Definition of clausal strategies to annotate

The followings are how we will tag on different types of clauses:

| Label                               | definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [T-unit](T-unit.md)                 | A T-unit consists of a `MAIN` clause and any dependent (i.e., `SUBORDINATE` or `EMBEDDED`) clauses attached to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [MAIN](MAIN.md)        | An independent clause, which function as complete unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [SUBORDINATE](SUBORDINATE.md) | A dependent clause attached to a main clause through the use of subordinate conjunctions (e.g., `because`, `although`, `if`, `when`, `as`, `while`, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [EMBEDDED](EMBEDDED.md)       | a type of dependent clause that function as a part of another clause. That is, an embedded clause is included in a subject, object of another clause (i.e., complement clause) or function as an adjective to modify a noun (i.e., relative clause). Inserted clauses, such as parataxis, are also considered as a type of embedded clause. |
| [FRAGMENT](FRAGMENT.md)               | An imcomplete sentential unit. Typically, without any verbs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |


{: .note }
When we identify clauses, we do NOT consider punctuation at the end of the clause boundaries as a part of the clause.
