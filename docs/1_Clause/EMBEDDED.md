## Embedded clauses

{: .def}
> a type of dependent clause that function as a part of another clause. That is, an embedded clause is included in a subject, object of another clause (i.e., complement clause) or function as an adjective to modify a noun (i.e., relative clause). Inserted clauses, such as parataxis, are also considered as a type of embedded clause.

In the following examples, embedded clauses are _italicized_.

- The paper argued _[that average price is not a meaningful measure of market power]_. (The clause functions as an object of argue.)
- I wanna eat the ramen _[that she mentioned a couple of days ago]_. (The clause modifies "the ramen".)
- And you will meet a man _[who says American Airlines took away his life]_. (The clause modifies "a man".)
- The idea _[that a democratic school is one where kids have an equal vote (Embedded 1)]_ , _[I think (Embedded 2)]_ , is a mistake. (The clause is a complement of a noun.)

In webanno, you will annotate these in the following manner:

Here are some major types of embedded clauses.

### Verb + (that-)clause (Embedded)
This pattern typically occurs when clausal complement (such as that-clause) follows mental or communication verbs.

- The author argued _that television has helped to shrink the relative distance between people and countries_.
- I think _Mary teaches French_.
- It appears _that maximum price fixing does the greatest harm when set below a competitive level_.

### Noun + (that-)clause (Embedded)
This patterns occurs when a (that-)clause elaborates content of the noun expression. 

- _The idea that the company has a clear responsibility to the incident_ was rejected by the judge.
- Their argument was based on _the belief that a happy ending is a certainty_.
- Our conclusion is drawn based on _the fact that there was a correlation between the intensifier use and their perception of social identity_.


### Relative clauses (Embedded)
A relative clause is where a clause is used to modify a noun (antecedent). There are two main categories in the use of relative clause.

The first type of relative clause occures when a noun is modified by a whole clause. It is typically used to identify which noun they are talking about out of all the possible cases of the noun.
- The analysis should be regarded as _a tool which alerts us to the potential conflicts_.

The other type of relative clause typically elaborates the content of the whole clause or introduces additional information about the noun expression/whole clause.

- We included all participants into the analysis with the exception of _the Italian participants, which was necessary to control for their native languages._
