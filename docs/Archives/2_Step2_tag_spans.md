# Step 2 — Engagement Spans

This section deals with structural/grammatical issues during the annotation, particularly the decisions involving where to put the tag. Each section below deals with possible grammatical structure for emgagement, and which items to put a tag on.

In the example in this document, the span for which the tag should be put is shown in **Bold** face.

>When in doubt, you can test whether the span is reasonable by separating an idea/issue/problem at hand (i.e., propositional content) from the author's view on that matter.
> Here is an easy example:
> - I think that people are very generous to tourists around here.
>
> Here, `people are very generous to tourists around here` is the idea/issue/problem under consideration. The writer of this sentence uses `I think (= ENTERTAIN)` as an engagement device to say this view is only mine (and there may be other views.)
> 
>To extend this approach, consider the following example:
> - A few years ago, I wrote expressing my concern that the village of West Linton, Peeblesshire, had 'moved'.
>
> In this example, the writer of this sentence says that they expressed their concern by writing. The matter (i.e., propositional content) is the idea/fact that `the village of West Linton, Peeblesshire, had 'moved'`.
> This is the actual content, on which the writer of this sentence takes stances. Then, the question becomes if the writer of this sentence takes any positions on this matter of discussion (Contract? or Expand?). 
> Based on this, I would suggest the following:
>
>- A few years ago, I **wrote expressing my concern that** the village of West Linton, Peeblesshire, had 'moved'.
>
> In this sentence, the writer says that they wrote something. What did they write?—Their concern. Although `wrote` is a concrete action verb, which tends NOT to take on engagement, the non-finite subordinate clause (i.e., expressing SOMETHING) roughly equals to `I said SOMETHING`. Technically, we do not have `ACTION verb + COMMUNICATION verb + Shell noun + that` as a pattern in the list above. However, we can think of putting an `engagement` move on this span. The question becomes then whether we will take `my concern that` or the `ACTION verb + COMMUNICATION verb + Shell noun + that` sequence as a whole. Here we need to think what makes more sense as the writers' possible communicative purposes. If we separate `wrote` from `my concern`, then we would have to treat `wrote` as `MONOGLOSS` and `my concern` as secondary `ENTERTAIN`. On the other hand, if we treat the whole span as single Engagement move, then we can treat the whole as `ENTERTAIN`. This may result in disagreement/discussion, but we may consider that the whole thing as almost equivalent to `I said that ...` then we see them as a whole.


## It is X that/to— as Interpersonal metaphor

Updated in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

When there is `It is X that ~`, `It is X to ~` or `there is/are X that` construction, we will tag the entire span of this construction. 
This decision is based on the fact that these construction function as introducing the stance of the writer as a whole (they almost function as chunks). 

When the `that-clause` govern the following clause, the tag spans are from `It/There` to `that`:
- **It’s probable/likely/possible that** he’s lying.
- **It is possible that** it is your duty to tell me.
- **It is absolutely clear to me that** what Charlotte was arguing was that Crouching Tiger was a bad film to which liberal audiences imputed a significance shaped by their own prejudices about Chinese cinema and the Chinese in general.
- **There is no doubt that** globalization has a deep effect on China.
- However, **there is mounting evidence that** processes of language acquisition, use, and change are not independent of one another but are facets of the same system.

When a `to-infinitive` govern the following clause, the tag spans are from `It` to the adjectival complement.
- **It is possible** for a layer of ice to form under the circumstances.
- But **it is likely** to have an impact in the near future.
- It was found, for example, that **it is more likely** to occur in NNS–NNS dyads rather than between NSs and NNSs (Varonis & Gass, 1985 ).
- **It would be possible** to suppose, for instance, that the tnre Schrodinger-like equation involves non-linearities.

In the following pattern, we can identify two strategies.
- It seems fairly obvious to most people that Watson tremendously oversimplified the learning process.

First, `It seems fairly obvious` gets a span, because this is a variant of `It is X to`.
Second, `seems` should get another tag because they add `ENTERTAIN` value to the author's assessment using `fairly obvious`.

- **It *seems* fairly obvious** to most people that Watson tremendously oversimplified the learning process.
