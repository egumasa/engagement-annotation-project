### Expository

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

{: .def}
> Expository devices signal elaboration of a concept in the subsequent part of the text. 

#### Description

Simply, the Exemplifying tag is used for expressions that are functionally equivalent to `in other words`, `that is to say`. So, this category includes following expressions:

- `to put it differently`, `put differently`, `that is`, `i.e.`, `namely`, `I mean`


#### Examples

- Our findings also showed that perceived accents were detected even for those Finnish‐born Turkish children who had started to acquire the L2 at the age of 2.5. **This means that** L2 phonological acquisition seems to result in non‐native accents even with an AO as early as 2.5 years. 
- How much do learners really use captions? **In other words**, how much attention do language learners give captions?
- The complexity meta‐theory groups together a set of well‐known relational principles (Overton, 2013 ), **namely that** certain phenomena involve multiple parts interacting together through dynamic, nonlinear processes that lead to striking emergent patterns over time.
