## Quoted materials or Direct quotes


NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

Quoted tags are used to indicate that the materials in that span is NOT the writer's wording, but something borrowed from other sources. 
This tag allows us to separate the writer's own engagement move from the direct quotes of other persons' engagement. 

### SPAN

When you use this tag, put a tag from **the quotation mark which starts the quote** to **the closing quotation mark**. We do not differentiate whether they are single or double quotation marks, or whether it has weirdly formated characters (e.g., `”`, `'`). We will use this tag for a segment of text whether you (as a potential reader) can identify that the segment is NOT the writer's own wording, but borrowed materials. 
If you do not identify the start or end of the quotation in the annotation file, you can indicate this by staring the `QUOTE` tag from the beginning or the end of the annotation file (to indicate the continuation).
