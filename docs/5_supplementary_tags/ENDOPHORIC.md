> Endophoric markers are text segments (expressions) that refer to information in other parts of its own text

#### Description

Endophoric markers are used to mark any mentions to the other parts of its own text. Typically, the marker includes following expressions:

- `(In) Chapter X`, `(In) Part X`, `(In) Section X`, `(In) the X chapter`, `(In) the X part`, `(In) the X section`, `(In) This chapter`, `(In) This part`, `(In) This section`, 
- `Example X`, `Fig.X`, `Figure X`, `P. X`, `Page X`, `Table X`, (these have to be within its own text, and not from external sources.)
- `X above`, `X above`, `X before`, `X below`, `X earlier`, `X later`,

#### Examples

- As described **above**, other participants felt financial and psychological constraints that resulted in maintaining what Foucault (1995) recognized as the discipline of routine.
- **Table 5** lists three methods frequently used in the literature.
- Response to Joan Kelly Hall's article by Paul Seedhouse follows **on page 527 of this paper**.
- As discussed **in Chapter 1** and further developed **in Chapter 2**, frequency of occurrence is less important than the contingency between cue and interpretation. (Assumed that these Chapters are from the text itself.)
- As **Table 3** shows, vocabulary size and depth were significantly correlated.
- As **Figure 7** shows, to provide a manual enactment of the literal meaning of “sever,” the teacher raises his right hand off the table, brings it to face level, as if in readiness to cut off a limb, then executes a swift downward chopping movement.
- As illustrated **in Figure 3**, contexts of biliteracy can occur along continua of micro to macro scales, characterized by more oral or written language use and by multiple languages or only monolingual resources—or anywhere in between.
