# Text organizing devices 

- Text organizing devices includes "discourse signals" that "refers to discourse acts, sequencing, and text-stages" (or what Hyland's called `frame markers`; Hyland, 2005)
- The following tags are used when we interpret the writer's intension is to let the reader know about the organization of its own text itself (independent from the content of the argument).

| Tag                                                                    | Description                                                       | Examples                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Goal-announcing](./3_Frame_markers.md#goal-announcing)                | Signal the purpose/goals of the text itself                       | `my purpose is`, `Section 2 describes`, `the chapter/section focuses/proposes`, `we intend to`, `in this chapter` |
| [Text-sequencing/staging](./3_Frame_markers.md#text-sequencingstaging) | Signal sequences and stages of argumentative elements in the text | `First`\*, `Lastly`\*, `to start with`, `so far`, `overall`,                                                      |
| ‖—[Summative**](./3_Frame_markers.md#summative)                        | Signal summary/conclusion of a part of the text                   | `to conclude`, `in short`, `to sum up`, `The conclusion is`                                                       |

`*` in the table shows that the item's function needs to be distinguished between `logical` and `text-organizing`.

## Goal-announcing

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

{: .def}
> Goal-announcing expressions are those that signal the purpose/goals of (a part of) the text itself.

### Description

Two typical patterns of goal announcing include:

- The writer of the sentence describes the goals/purposes of the piece of text.
- The writer of the sentence announces what is going to be written about in the immediate piece of writing.

Typical items categorized as goal-announcing are following (Bold-face are the span for this category.):


- **We aim to present** ...
- **The goal of this section/chapter/paper is** ...
- **In this section, we demonstrate** ....
- **This chapter focuses on**
- **This paper seeks to identify** three key elements of effective communication.


{: .tips}
> Typical constructions for this category include: 
> - **Prepositional phrases `Prep + Det + Noun`**: `(in) this chapter`, `(in) this part`, `(in) this section`
> - **Communication and mental verbs `SUBJ + VERB`**: `we aim to V`, `intend to V`, `I focus on Ving`, `I want to V`, `We wish to V`, `I would like to V`
> -> These verbs helps the writer of the sentence to announce the goal of the writing explicitly. 
> - **Nominalized constructions `Possessive + NOUN (+ is/are)`**: `Our objectives are`, `My purpose here is`, `intention`
> -> These nouns, when used with `The X of this paper/section is to` or similar construction, signals the goals of the writing.


### Examples (Span of this category is shown in bold-face.)

- *In order to address the issues outlined in the introduction (PURPORSE)*, **the study aimed to** uncover the processes through which the three writers completed their assignments.
- **The aim of this study is to** shed some light on whether it is beneficial to devote classroom time to the explicit teaching of a limited number of academic FS and how this might be best achieved.
- **I will now discuss** each of these core businesses.

## Text-sequencing/staging

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

{: .def}
> Text-sequencing/staging devices signal sequences and stages of argumentative elements in the text. 

There are three subcategories of markers, which we classify under this `TEXT-SEQUENCING` category.

### Sequencing

Text sequences typically signals the order of the elements to be considered in the argument. 
For example, writers may list three reasons for their argument by using sequencing: `first`, `second` and `third/last`. This is the typical use of text-sequencing devices.

Other less obvious examples include:

- `to start with` (to initiate the discussion)
- `then` (to organize the argument) 
- Listing and numbering such as `a.`, `b.`, and `c.` or `1.`, `2.`, and `3.`.
- `Firstly`, `next`, `subsequently`, `finally`, `lastly`, and similarly functioning expressions.


### Staging

Text staging typically act as a signal where the current statement stands in the overall argument.

- `so far`, `at this point`, `thus far` (to remind the reader of what has been talked about previously)
- `for the moment` (to indicate that the thesis is going to be developed in the later section)


### Topic-shifting

- `now`, `moving onto X`, `regarding X`, `back to` (to signal a shift in topic of discussion)


## Examples

- **In this section** we first describe the student participants’ reports of their experiences and their perceptions of their EAP classes, and then the teachers’ perceptions.
- **First**, a supportive online environment should enable learners to take charge of their online actions ... **Second**, resonating with previous findings ... **Finally**, to increase students’ engagement and motivation, online writing tools could incorporate popular gaming elements.
- **First**, despite its macrostructure, the RA shouldhave a separate Discussion section. **Second**, the first availabledrafts had to have been written by the students (the first authors) on their own. 
- **Returning to the more frequent referential discourse function**, normalized mean per-text counts of the subfunctions between sub-corpora are displayed in Table 7.
- We **now** look at our results in more detail, beginning with moves.
- The possible explanation are **two-fold**. The **first** explanation concerns the way in which ...
- The items had been produced by ANPWS **for the following reasons** : **( a )** to generate publicity ( for some of Australia 's national parks ) , **( b )** to meet existing information requests from school students and the general public ( such as on Australia 's endangered plants ) , **( c )** to generate interest in particular topics ( such as remnant vegetation ) , and **( d )** to explain government policy ( on kangaroo harvesting ) . 


The followings are NOT examples of `Text-sequence`:

- the sample encompassed the _first, second, third, and fourth_ year candidates along with graduate students.

## Summative

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

{: .def}
> Summative devices are those that signal summaries and restatements in the text.


### Description

Simply, the Exemplifying tag is used for expressions that are functionally equivalent to `in summary` and `in short`. So, this category includes following expressions:

- `to conclude`, `in brief`, `in conclusion`, `in short`, `in sum`, `in summary`, `to sum up`, `to summarize`
- `to repeat`, `to reiterate`, `again`

Expressions of summative devices are considered in one way a subcategory of text-staging devices, but we will deal with this category separately because of the significance of its function in an argumentative discourse.


### Examples

- **To summarize**, the concept of parallel language use is not transparent.
- **Overall**, we believe that the concepts of linguistic capital and performative competence complement each other by allowing us to see how professional capabilities and practices are construed in discourse.
