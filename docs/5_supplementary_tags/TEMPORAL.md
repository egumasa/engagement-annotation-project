### Temporal expressions

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

{: .def}
> Temporal markers are devices that refer to when an event referenced in the clause happened.

#### Description

Temporal expressions express the time of an action or event happened. Importantly, this should NOT be confused with `Text-sequencing` markers. While text-sequencing markers acts as signals to organize the argument, temporal markers are literally expressions of `TIME`. 

Typical ways that temporal expressions are used include:

- `When` clause to add information about the timing of an event relative to the other event.
- Time related expressions such as `on weekends`, `at 11 pm`, etc.
