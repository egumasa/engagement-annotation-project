### Summative

{: .def}
> Summative devices are those that signal summaries and restatements in the text.


#### Description

Simply, the Exemplifying tag is used for expressions that are functionally equivalent to `in summary` and `in short`. So, this category includes following expressions:

- `to conclude`, `in brief`, `in conclusion`, `in short`, `in sum`, `in summary`, `to sum up`, `to summarize`
- `to repeat`, `to reiterate`, `again`

Expressions of summative devices are considered in one way a subcategory of text-staging devices, but we will deal with this category separately because of the significance of its function in an argumentative discourse.
