### Goal-announcing

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

{: .def}
> Goal-announcing expressions are those that signal the purpose/goals of (a part of) the text itself.

#### Description

Two typical patterns of goal announcing include:

- The writer of the sentence describes the goals/purposes of the piece of text.
- The writer of the sentence announces what is going to be written about in the immediate piece of writing.

Typical items categorized as goal-announcing are following (Bold-face are the span of this category.):

- **We aim to present** ...
- **The goal of this section/chapter/paper is** ...
- **In this section, we demonstrate** ....
- **This chapter focuses on**
- **This paper seeks to identify** three key elements of effective communication.


Other patterns of goal-announcing include:
- **Prepositional phrases**: `(in) this chapter`, `(in) this part`, `(in) this section`

-> These expressions are used to describe the part in which the current writing is going to accomplish some goals.
- **Communication and mental verbs**: `aim`, `intend to`, `focus on`, `want to`, `wish to`, `would like to`

-> These verbs helps the writer of the sentence to announce the goal of the writing explicitly. 
- **Nominalized constructions**: `objective`, `purpose`, `intention`

-> These nouns, when used with `The X of this paper/section is to` or similar construction, signals the goals of the writing.
