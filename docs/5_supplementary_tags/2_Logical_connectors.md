## Logical connections/ Transition phrases

According to Hyland:
These are: "conjunctions and adverbial phrases which help readers interpret pragmatic connections between steps in an argument." (p. 50).
They expresse logical connections that the writer of the sentence try to weave throughout the discourse.

- Tags in this categories are those that the writer uses to cohesively link between their ideas and argumentative elements. So, these tags are more relevant to the actual content of the argument (compared to `Text organizing devices` below).
- Here we are dealing with logical connections that were NOT the foci of ENGAGEMENT moves (e.g., `COUNTER`).

| Tag                              | Description                                                         | Examples                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Exemplifying](#exemplifying)    | Signal illustrations/examples in the text                           | `for example`, `to illustrate`, `e.g.`,                     |
| [Expository](#expository)        | Signal elaboration/clarification in the subsequent part of the text | `in other words`, `that is`, `i.e.`, `I mean`, `this means` |
| [Additive]                       | Signal                                                              |                                                             |
| Compare/Contrast                 | Signal                                                              |                                                             |
| [Justifying](#justifying)        | Signal persuasion through justification or substantiation.          | `because of X`, `due to X`, `therefore`                     |
| [Purpose/Result](#purposeresult) | Signal Purposes and Result                                          | `as a result`, `for that purpose`, `in order to X`          |
| Causal                           | Signal causal relationships                                         | `because of X`, `due to X`, `therefore`                     |


`*` in the table shows that the item's function needs to be distinguished between `logical` and `text-organizing`.



{: .tips}
> Justifying is equivalent to the `JUSTIFY` tag in the previous version (ver 1). The reason for this change is based on the observation that `JUSTIFY` can co-occur with `MONOGLOSS`, which suggests the distinct roles of justification.

### Exemplifying

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

{: .def}
> Exemplifying are devices that signal illustrations/examples in the text.

#### Description

Simply, the Exemplifying tag is used for expressions that are functionally equivalent to `for example`. So, this category includes following expressions:

- `for example`, `for instance`, `to illustrate`, `such as`, `e.g.,`

#### Examples

### Expository

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

{: .def}
> Expository devices signal elaboration of a concept in the subsequent part of the text. 

#### Description

Simply, the Exemplifying tag is used for expressions that are functionally equivalent to `in other words`, `that is to say`. So, this category includes following expressions:

- `to put it differently`, `put differently`, `that is`, `i.e.`, `namely`, `I mean`


#### Examples

- Our findings also showed that perceived accents were detected even for those Finnish‐born Turkish children who had started to acquire the L2 at the age of 2.5. **This means** that L2 phonological acquisition seems to result in non‐native accents even with an AO as early as 2.5 years. 
- How much do learners really use captions? **In other words**, how much attention do language learners give captions?
- The complexity meta‐theory groups together a set of well‐known relational principles (Overton, 2013 ), **namely** that certain phenomena involve multiple parts interacting together through dynamic, nonlinear processes that lead to striking emergent patterns over time.

## Additive

{: .def}
> Additive conjunctives helps add more argumentative elements to the discourse. This tags are not applicable to additional events/entity. Also excluded are simple coordinating conjunctions (e.g., and), which do not function as an argument-adding discourse marker.

Typical transition markers include:
- `additionally`, `in addition`, `further`, `furthermore`, `moreover`, `also`, `again`, `what is more`, `besides`, `not only that but`, etc.



{: .tips}
> Exclude "and" from the tag if you CANNOT paraphrase it with other prototypical Additive conjunctions such as "moreover", "additionally"

### Examples

- The findings **further** supported that social workers were sympathetic towards the abused wives.
- **Additionally**, awareness-raising activities led by writing professionals were found to effectively reduce instances of text-based plagiarism in students’ writing (Huang, 2014). However, writing professionals sometimes encounter difficulties in teaching discipline-specific EAP courses. **In addition**, writing in such EAP courses taught by language instructors may lack authenticity.
- My client says he does not know this witness. **Further**, he denies ever having seen her or spoken to her.

## Comparison

{: .def}
> Contrastive conjunctives signals similarity or dissimilarity between two argumentative elements.

Comparison conjunctive include markers expressing similarity:
- `similarly`, `likewise`, `in the same way`

It also include markers expressing dissimilarity:
- `on the other hand`, `by contrast`, `conversely`

### Example
- Your directors are planning for steady growth over a considerable period of time. **Similarly** our intentions in adopting this new investment policy are focused on the long-term prospects ofthe company.
- Treating people as responsible citizens brings out the best in them; they behave as such. **In the same way** if you treat thenl as criminals they will soon begin to act like criminals.
- Why aren't you going in for a swim? - **On the one hand**, the air's too cold; I like to be warm when I come out. **On the other hand**, the current's too strong; I like to be sure I SHALL come out.


{: .caution}
> Comparison conjunctives are very similar to `COUNTER` move in engagement, but they are distinct. In `COUNTER`, the wording will have intention to `DISCLAIM` viewpoint(s) in order to claim another (e.g., `rather`, `not ... but ...`). On the other hamd, `Comparison` conjunctives simply list (and potentially explore the differences of) two or more options.


---
## Adversive (almost overlapping with `COUNTER`)

This category includes conjunctive relations characterized by `but`, `however`, `though`. We anticipate that this tag is mostly subsumed under `COUNTER` move in engagement (but probably not the other way around).

### Example
- All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella, with himselfin it ... **But** he couldn't quite succeed,
- ... it swept her straight off the seat, and down among the heap of rushes. **However**, she wasn't a bit hurt, and was soon up again.

### Justifying

{: .def}
>An utterance which engage in persuasion through justification or substantiation.

This move is typically achieved by subordinate clauses or prepositional phrases expressing causal relations and causes (e.g., `because`, `considering that`, `given that`, `because of`, `due to`, `for this reason`).

- **Because the steps are made of a smooth, polished—and therefore slippery—stone**, the BTA should’ve taken precautions to clean the steps in such wintry conditions.
- Accessibility is quite a key factor **because it is evident that the regional centre was built on the basis of good infrastructure**.
- **Because of the event happening next year**, the housing prices have gone up so rapidly around here.
- **Given that about a quarter of all employed people move on and off the payrolls of individual firms during the year** , a need to move between firms to climb the career ladder would not seem to be a difficult barrier to surmount .
- The items had been produced by ANPWS **for the following reasons** : ( a ) to generate publicity ( for some of Australia 's national parks ) , ( b ) to meet existing information requests from school students and the general public ( such as on Australia 's endangered plants ) , ( c ) to generate interest in particular topics ( such as remnant vegetation ) , and ( d ) to explain government policy ( on kangaroo harvesting ) .

We will also consider logical connectors such as `so`, `therefore`, `thus`, `accordingly`, `as such` as Justify. Note that `so` needs to be used to show logical relations to be tagged as `Justify`. 
- **Accordingly**, a learner with a score of 50 is considered to have a vocabulary size of 5,000 words.
- **As such**, a student can develop, or fail to develop, an isolated skill distinct from their general performance across skills.
- Literacy varies within contexts; **therefore**, a single " literacy " does not exist.
