## Logical connections/ Transition phrases

{: .def}
> According to Hyland:
> Logical connectors are: "conjunctions and adverbial phrases which help readers interpret pragmatic connections between steps in an argument." (Hyland, 2005, p. 50).

They express logical connections that the writer of the sentence try to weave throughout the discourse. We will attend to connectors that signal the relationships between argumentative elements.

**Unless otherwise noted**, we will attend to connectors that attempt to connect two or more argumentative elements within the discourse and disregard connectors that express relations between real-world events. Often times, the distinction is explained as `internal` (within discourse) and `external` (out of discourse) conjunctive relations.


| Logical connection we annotate                                | Description                                                                                                                                    | Examples                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Exemplifying](./2_Logical_connectors.md#exemplifying)        | Signal illustrations/examples in the text (mostly `internal`).                                                                                 | `for example`, `to illustrate`, `e.g.`,                     |
| [Expository](./2_Logical_connectors.md#expository)            | Signal elaboration/clarification in the subsequent part of the text (mostly `internal`).                                                       | `in other words`, `that is`, `i.e.`, `I mean`, `this means` |
| [Additive](./2_Logical_connectors.md#additive)–internal       | Signal additional argumentative elements; Focus only on `internal` relations.                                                                  | `additionally`, `moreover`, `besides`                       |
| [Comparative](./2_Logical_connectors.md#comparative)-internal | Marks an argument as similar or different. This category has to be differentiated from `COUNTER` move.                                         | `similarly`, `by contrast`, `conversely`                    |
| [Justifying](./2_Logical_connectors.md#justifying)            | Signal persuasion through justification or substantiation. For the reason of simplicity, we will include both external and internal relations. | `because of X`, `due to X`, `therefore`                     |


Some category of logical connectors are subsumed under some `engagement` moves or other supplementary tags. These are summarized as follows:

| Logical connection we omit | Reason for the omission                                                  | Examples                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ~~Concede~~                | Already covered in `CONCUR`                                              | `admittedly`                                           |
| ~~Adversative~~            | Already covered in `PROCLAIM` (e.g., `PRONOUNCE`/`CONCUR`)               | `in fact`, `actually`, `as a matter of fact`           |
| ~~Alternative~~            | May be interpreted as `ENTERTAIN`                                        | `alternatively`                                        |
| ~~Dismissive~~             | May be interpreted as `PRONOUNCE/COUNTER`                                | `anyway`, `at any rate` (= all things considered, yet) |
| ~~Time—internal~~          | Already covered in `Text-sequencing` (because it's ordering of argument) | `first`, `second`                                      |
| ~~Additive-external~~      | Out of scope: They express A and B in the real-world.                    | `A and B`,                                             |
| ~~Temporal-external~~      | Out of scope: They express `Ideational` meaning.                         | `today`, `on weekends`, I talked to you `previously`   |
| ~~Purpose/result~~         | Out of scope: Many of them have `Ideational` meaning.                    | `in order to x`                                        |

`*` in the table shows that the item's function needs to be distinguished between `logical` and `text-organizing`.



{: .tips}
> Justifying is equivalent to the `JUSTIFY` tag in the previous version (ver 1). The reason for this change is based on the observation that `JUSTIFY` can co-occur with `MONOGLOSS`, which suggests the distinct roles of justification.

### Exemplifying

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

{: .def}
> Exemplifying are devices that signal illustrations/examples in the text.

#### Description

Simply, the Exemplifying tag is used for expressions that are functionally equivalent to `for example`. So, this category includes following expressions:

- `for example`, `for instance`, `to illustrate`, `such as`, `e.g.`

#### Examples

- Factive verbs **such as** ‘hold’, ‘state’, ‘note’ and ‘require’ were prevalent for courts and legislation while non-factive verbs **such as** ‘claim’ and ‘comment’ were used to report academics’ views.

### Expository

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

{: .def}
> Expository devices signal elaboration of a concept in the subsequent part of the text. 

#### Description

Simply, the Exemplifying tag is used for expressions that are functionally equivalent to `in other words`, `that is to say`. So, this category includes following expressions:

- `to put it differently`, `put differently`, `that is`, `i.e.`, `namely`, `I mean`


#### Examples

- Our findings also showed that perceived accents were detected even for those Finnish‐born Turkish children who had started to acquire the L2 at the age of 2.5. **This means** that L2 phonological acquisition seems to result in non‐native accents even with an AO as early as 2.5 years. 
- How much do learners really use captions? **In other words**, how much attention do language learners give captions?
- The complexity meta‐theory groups together a set of well‐known relational principles (Overton, 2013 ), **namely** that certain phenomena involve multiple parts interacting together through dynamic, nonlinear processes that lead to striking emergent patterns over time.
- Quoted segments consisting of less than a one T-unit were marked as “phrasal” and then coded according to their phrasal structure: “verb phrase,” (**defined as** one or more inflected verbs plus any modifiers, objects or complements accompanying them), “noun phrase,” (**defined as** one or morenouns plus any modifiers accompanying them) or “adjective phrase” (**defined as** one or more adjectives plus any modifiers accompanying them).
- The last reason why Persian writers overused 6-word lexical bundles may be because Persian writers often tended to avoid, **or** modify, the structures of particular lexical bundles which result in awkward use of them. **In other words**, Persian writers conveyed a particular function (**i.e.**, structuring signal), using an unnatural structure. *For instance [EXEMPLYING]*, the 6-word lexical bundles in *examples (10), (11) [ENDOPHORIC]* are modified versions of as can be seen *in table in extract 9 [ENDOPHORIC]*, which English writers did not choose.

## Additive

{: .def}
> Additive conjunctives helps add more argumentative elements to the discourse. This tags are not applicable to additional events/entity. Also excluded are simple coordinating conjunctions (e.g., and), which do not function as an argument-adding discourse marker.

Typical transition markers include:
- `additionally`, `in addition`, `further`, `furthermore`, `moreover`, `also`, `again`, `what is more`, `besides`, `not only that but`, etc.



{: .tips}
> Exclude "and" from the tag if you CANNOT paraphrase it with other prototypical Additive conjunctions such as "moreover", "additionally"

### Examples

- The findings **further** supported that social workers were sympathetic towards the abused wives.
- **Additionally**, awareness-raising activities led by writing professionals were found to effectively reduce instances of text-based plagiarism in students’ writing (Huang, 2014). However, writing professionals sometimes encounter difficulties in teaching discipline-specific EAP courses. **In addition**, writing in such EAP courses taught by language instructors may lack authenticity.
- My client says he does not know this witness. **Further**, he denies ever having seen her or spoken to her.
- **Furthermore**, when we failed an exam in June, we can have it in September. **And** if we are interested, we can spend six months abroad but we must pass the FCE.

## Comparative

{: .def}
> Comparative conjunctives signals similarity or dissimilarity between two argumentative elements.

Comparison conjunctive include markers expressing similarity:
- `similarly`, `likewise`, `in the same way`

It also include markers expressing dissimilarity:
- `on the other hand`, `by contrast`, `conversely`

### Example

- Your directors are planning for steady growth over a considerable period of time. **Similarly** our intentions in adopting this new investment policy are focused on the long-term prospects ofthe company.
- Treating people as responsible citizens brings out the best in them; they behave as such. **In the same way** if you treat thenl as criminals they will soon begin to act like criminals.
- Why aren't you going in for a swim? - **On the one hand**, the air's too cold; I like to be warm when I come out. **On the other hand**, the current's too strong; I like to be sure I SHALL come out.
- Genres produced include book chapters, journal articles and conference proceedings; *however (COUNTER)*, none of the five informants produced a journal article in Swedish, **whereas all have written journal articles in English (Comparison)**. The linguists are also less visibly active than historians in terms of outreach genres; *nonetheless (COUNTER)*, English and Swedish have been used in this domain by at least one informant. **On the other hand (Comparison)**, they have been more active than historians in using digital media such as blogs, which have appeared in both English and Swedish.

{: .caution}
> Comparison conjunctives are very similar to `COUNTER` move in engagement, but they are distinct. In `COUNTER`, the wording will have intention to `DISCLAIM` viewpoint(s) in order to claim another (e.g., `rather`, `not ... but ...`). On the other hand, `Comparison` conjunctives simply list (and potentially explore the differences of) two or more options.


---
### Justifying 

{: .def}
>An utterance which engage in persuasion through justification or substantiation.

This move is typically achieved by subordinate clauses or prepositional phrases expressing causal relations and causes (e.g., `because`, `considering that`, `given that`, `because of`, `due to`, `for this reason`).

- **Because the steps are made of a smooth, polished—and therefore slippery—stone**, the BTA should’ve taken precautions to clean the steps in such wintry conditions.
- Accessibility is quite a key factor **because it is evident that the regional centre was built on the basis of good infrastructure**.
- **Because of the event happening next year**, the housing prices have gone up so rapidly around here.
- **Given that about a quarter of all employed people move on and off the payrolls of individual firms during the year** , a need to move between firms to climb the career ladder would not seem to be a difficult barrier to surmount .
- The Act required that the application should be dealt with in a public hearing ... **Thus** there is the penalty of public exposure and humiliation
- The lack of connection between the SLA theories, which tend to be English or European languages based, and the Japanese teaching that is found in JLT is probably **due to a lack of attention to pragmatic and sociocultural aspects of Japanese language and communication**.
- **Perhaps due to a seeming disconnect between written and oral output**, only a handful of studies to date have examined the potential impact of SCMC on oral language proficiency. 

We will also consider logical connectors such as `so`, `therefore`, `thus`, `accordingly`, `as such` as Justify. Note that `so` needs to be used to show logical relations to be tagged as `Justify`. 
- **Accordingly**, a learner with a score of 50 is considered to have a vocabulary size of 5,000 words.
- **As such**, a student can develop, or fail to develop, an isolated skill distinct from their general performance across skills.
- Literacy varies within contexts; **therefore**, a single " literacy " does not exist.
