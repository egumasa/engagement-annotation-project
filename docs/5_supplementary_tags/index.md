# Step 5—Annotatiting Supplementary moves in Engagement resource analysis


In order to fully account for the rhetorical moves that the writers employ, we will supplement the `engagement` resource analysis with additional set of supplementary tags. These tags are particularly informed by the notion of `metadiscourse` (e.g., Hyland, 2005), which attempts to capture writer's "self-refletive expressions used to negotiate interactional meanings in a text" (Hyland, 2005, p. 37). Importantly, `metadiscourse` (Hyland, 2005) and `engagement` (Martin & White, 2005) shares some important conceptual underpinnings and considered complementary approaches to each other. These theoretical frameworks, particularly inspired by Systemic Functional Lingusitics (Halliday), underscores functions of language which relates to "maintainance of interpersonal relations" and "organization of discourse segments". The supplementary tags defined below are ways to uncover the writer's stragety to organize the discourse in their writings.

The supplementary tags are broadly categorized into two categories:

1. Reference to materials that are either internal or external to its own text
2. Conjunctive relations

These categories are described in turn below.

## 1. Reference to information internal or external to the writing

The first category aims to identify the elements of discourse which refers to any internal/external materials. For our purpose, these tags go hand-in-hand with engagement moves such as `ATTRIBUTE` and `ENDORSE`, allowing us to identify whether the writer makes explicit references to the "sources" of their argument.

- `Citations` and `Sources` are two category that pertains to how `EXTERNAL` materials are referenced in the discourse.
- `ENDOPHORIC` pertains to how the writer refers to the other part of its own writing.

| Tag                                   | Description                                                                                   | Examples                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| References to external sources        |                                                                                               |                                               |
| ‖—[Citations](CITATION.md)            | Mentions to external source(s) in the text in forms of in-text or narrative citation.         | `(Martin & White, 2005)`, `Ortega (2009)`,    |
| ‖—[Sources](Sources.md)               | Mentions to external source(s) in the text in forms of nominal expression.                    | `The annual report by X`, `Numerous studies`  |
| References text internally            |                                                                                               |                                               |
| ‖—[Endophoric markers](ENDOPHORIC.md) | Refer to information in other parts of its own text                                           | as noted `above`, see `Fig 1`, `in section 2` |
| [Quoted](QUOTED.md)                   | Segment of text with direct quotation (including the quotation marks, both single and double) | `"Stay hungry. Stay foolish."`                |

{: .tips}
> Citation/External source tag subsumes CITATION in the previous (version 1) guideline. It additionally include explicit reference to external materials (e.g., written or oral report, news, discussion, etc.).
> Citation is moved to supplementary category because it can co-occur with `MONOGLOSS`.



## 2. Conjunctive relations


## `Internal` vs `External` conjunctive relations

The differences between `Text-sequencing` and `TEMPORAL` tags can be characterized in terms of the following two concept.

- `Internal` conjunctive relations concern the sequencial unfolding of the text itself. This is the characteristics of `TEXT-SEQUENCING` expressions.

- `External` conjunctive relations concern "the temporal sequence of" the actual real-world events referred to (Halliday 1994: 325). This is the characteristics of `TEMPORAL` expressions.


## Logical connections/ Transition phrases

- Tags in this categories are those that the writer uses to cohesively link between their ideas and argumentative elements. So, these tags are more relevant to the actual content of the argument (compared to `Text organizing devices` below).
- Here we are dealing with logical connections that were NOT the foci of ENGAGEMENT moves (e.g., `COUNTER`).

| Tag                             | Description                                                         | Examples                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Exemplifying](EXEMPLIFYING.md) | Signal illustrations/examples in the text                           | `for example`, `to illustrate`, `e.g.`,                     |
| [Expository](EXPOSITORY.md)     | Signal elaboration/clarification in the subsequent part of the text | `in other words`, `that is`, `i.e.`, `I mean`, `this means` |
| Additive                        | Signal                                                              |                                                             |
| Compare/Contrast                | Signal                                                              |                                                             |
| [Justifying](JUSTIFY.md)        | Signal persuasion through justification or substantiation.          | `because of X`, `due to X`, `therefore`                     |
| [Purpose/Result](PURPOSE.md)    | Signal Purposes and Result                                          | `as a result`, `for that purpose`, `in order to X`          |
| Causal                          | Signal causal relationships                                         | `because of X`, `due to X`, `therefore`                     |


`*` in the table shows that the item's function needs to be distinguished between `logical` and `text-organizing`.

> Justifying is equivalent to the `JUSTIFY` tag in the previous version (ver 1). The reason for this change is based on the observation that `JUSTIFY` can co-occur with `MONOGLOSS`, which suggests the distinct roles of justification.

## Text organizing devices 

- Text organizing devices includes "discourse signals" that "refers to discourse acts, sequencing, and text-stages" (or what Hyland's called `frame markers`; Hyland, 2005)
- The following tags are used when we interpret the writer's intension is to let the reader know about the organization of its own text itself (independent from the content of the argument).

| Tag                                         | Description                                                       | Examples                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Goal-announcing](GOAL.md)                  | Signal the purpose/goals of the text itself                       | `my purpose is`, `Section 2 describes`, `the chapter/section focuses/proposes`, `we intend to`, `in this chapter` |
| [Text-sequencing/staging](TEXT-SEQUENCE.md) | Signal sequences and stages of argumentative elements in the text | `First`\*, `Lastly`\*, `to start with`, `so far`, `overall`,                                                      |
| ‖—[Summative**](SUMMATIVE.md)               | Signal summary/conclusion of a part of the text                   | `to conclude`, `in short`, `to sum up`, `The conclusion is`                                                       |

`*` in the table shows that the item's function needs to be distinguished between `logical` and `text-organizing`.


## Expressions pertaining to the event itself

| Tag                             | Description                     | Examples                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Temporal markers](TEMPORAL.md) | Refer to when an event happened | `First`\*, `At last`, `finally`\*, `then`, `next time`, `previously` |






## Notes on theoretical framework

- Goal-announcing and text-sequencing and staging are based on Frame markers in Hyland (2005).
- Endophoric markers are based on Hyland (2005).
- Citations and Sources are related to Evidentials in Hyland (2005), but they are distinct given that Evidential is covered in Engagement (or ATTRIBUTE).
