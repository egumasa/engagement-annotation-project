## Step 5—Annotatiting Supplementary moves in Engagement resource analysis

The following tags essentially supplement the discourse moves (Step 2-4), so that the entire annotation provide more valuable information about the discourse moves as well as help the machine to identify the engagement resources more confidently.
At the final step of the annotation, we will provide annotation of these supplementary moves. This is set up as an independent layer in webanno, so they are considered conceptually separate from (but supplementary to) Engagement moves.
