# Step 5—Annotatiting Supplementary moves in Engagement resource analysis


In order to fully account for the rhetorical moves that the writers employ, we will supplement the `engagement` resource analysis with additional set of supplementary tags. These tags are particularly informed by the notion of `metadiscourse` (e.g., Hyland, 2005), which attempts to capture writer's "self-refletive expressions used to negotiate interactional meanings in a text" (Hyland, 2005, p. 37). Importantly, `metadiscourse` (Hyland, 2005) and `engagement` (Martin & White, 2005) shares some important conceptual underpinnings and considered complementary approaches to each other. These theoretical frameworks, particularly inspired by Systemic Functional Lingusitics (Halliday), underscores functions of language which relates to "maintainance of interpersonal relations" and "organization of discourse segments". The supplementary tags defined below are ways to uncover the writer's stragety to organize the discourse in their writings.

The supplementary tags are broadly categorized into two categories:

1. Reference to materials that are either internal or external to its own text
2. Logical connections / Text-organizing devices

These categories are described in turn below.

## 1. Reference to information internal or external to the writing

The first category aims to identify the elements of discourse which refers to any internal/external materials. For our purpose, these tags go hand-in-hand with engagement moves such as `ATTRIBUTE` and `ENDORSE`, allowing us to identify whether the writer makes explicit references to the "sources" of their argument.

- `Citations` and `Sources` are two category that pertains to how `EXTERNAL` materials are referenced in the discourse.
- `ENDOPHORIC` pertains to how the writer refers to the other part of its own writing.

| Tag                                                             | Description                                                                                   | Examples                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **References to external sources**                              |                                                                                               |                                               |
| ‖—[Citations](./1_Material_ref.md#citations)                    | Mentions to external source(s) in the text in forms of in-text or narrative citation.         | `(Martin & White, 2005)`, `Ortega (2009)`,    |
| ‖—[Sources](./1_Material_ref.md#sources)                        | Mentions to external source(s) in the text in forms of nominal expression.                    | `The annual report by X`, `Numerous studies`  |
| **References text internally**                                  |                                                                                               |                                               |
| ‖—[Endophoric markers](./1_Material_ref.md#endophoric-markers)  | Refer to information in other parts of its own text                                           | as noted `above`, see `Fig 1`, `in section 2` |
| [Quoted](./1_Material_ref.md#quoted-materials-or-direct-quotes) | Segment of text with direct quotation (including the quotation marks, both single and double) | `"Stay hungry. Stay foolish."`                |


## 2. Logical connections / Text-organizing devices

The second broad category of our supplementary tags relates to logical connectors. Typical examples are `moreover (Additive)`, `on the other hand (Comparative)`, `consequently (Justifying)`.

### What are logical connectors?

According to Hyland:

Logical connectors are: "conjunctions and adverbial phrases which help readers interpret pragmatic connections between steps in an argument." (p. 50).
They express logical connections that the writer of the sentence try to weave throughout the discourse. We will attend to connectors that signal the relationships between argumentative elements.

What we do NOT tag as logical connectors are those that refers to the relations of actual real-world events. The distinction is explained as `internal` (within discourse) and `external` (out of discourse) conjunctive relations.

### `Internal` vs `External` conjunctive relations

In our annotation project, we specifically attend to the logical connectors and text-sequencing devices that the writer uses to link argumentative elements in the discourse. This is called `internal` conjunction as it is about internal relations within the immediate discourse.

- `Internal` conjunctive relations concern the sequencial unfolding of the text itself. This is the scope of our supplementary tags. The followings illustrate these conjunctive moves.

>Crops accounted for a significant proportion of heavy metals dietary intake. **The reasons are two fold**. **Firstly (TEXT-SEQUENCE)**, crops are the bottom positions of many food chains and food webs. **Secondly (TEXT-SEQUENCE)**, vegetables are one of the major dietary components of Hong Kong people.

> To this point we have looked at clauses and their elements from the perspective of discourse. Grammarians, **on the other hand (Comparative)**, look at elements of clauses from the perspective of the grammar.

> The Act required that where the offence is a gross violation the application should be dealt with in a public hearing It is **also (Additive)** not true that ... amnesty encourages impunity because amnesty is only given to those who plead guilty... **Further (Additive)**, retributive justice.. .is not the only form of justice., .there is another kind of justice, restorative justice


The transition firstly and secondary, signal the argumentative elements in the discourse (writer's act).

- `External` conjunctive relations concern "the temporal sequence of" the actual real-world events referred to (Halliday 1994: 325). This is the characteristics of `TEMPORAL` expressions. The following example shows the external conjunction:

>For the boric acid indicator, **firstly (TEMPORAL; out of the scope)**, 5g of boric acid crystals was dissolved in 200ml of warm distilled water, **secondly (TEMPORAL; out of the scope)**, 40ml of methyl red indicator [0.02% (w/v) in 60% ethanol] and 15ml of bromocresol green indicator [0.1% (w/v) in 60% ethanol] were added to the boric acid solution.

> I answered the questions. **Subsequently (TEMPORAL; out of the scope)** I was told that I was lying.

> **Instead of resting at night (alternative choice made by him = not a COUNTER)**, he would wander from window to window.

> Four, maybe five policemen viciously knocked me down, **and (additive–external; out of the scope)** they put me back on the chair **and (additive-external; out of the scope)** handcuffed my hands through the chair 

> An extremely short marriage to someone else failed **all because I married to forget (not a Justifying)**.

These transitions signal the real-world processes. They do not logically connect ideas for argumentation.


## 2a. Logical connectors/ Transition phrases

- Tags in this categories are those that the writer uses to cohesively link between their ideas and argumentative elements.
- Here we are dealing with logical connections that were NOT the foci of ENGAGEMENT moves (e.g., `COUNTER`).

| Logical connection we annotate                                     | Description                                                                                            | Examples                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Exemplifying](./2_Logical_connectors.md#exemplifying)             | Signal illustrations/examples in the text (mostly `internal`).                                         | `for example`, `to illustrate`, `e.g.`,                     |
| [Expository](./2_Logical_connectors.md#expository)                 | Signal elaboration/clarification in the subsequent part of the text (mostly `internal`).               | `in other words`, `that is`, `i.e.`, `I mean`, `this means` |
| [Additive](./2_Logical_connectors.md#additive)–internal            | Signal additional argumentative elements; Focus only on `internal` relations.                          | `additionally`, `moreover`, `besides`                       |
| [Comparative](./2_Logical_connectors.md#comparison)-internal       | Marks an argument as similar or different. This category has to be differentiated from `COUNTER` move. | `similarly`, `by contrast`, `conversely`                    |
| [Justifying](./2_Logical_connectors.md#justifying)                 | Signal persuasion through justification or substantiation; this is equivalent to Causal-internal.      | `because of X`, `due to X`, `therefore`                     |
| [Purpose/Result](./2_Logical_connectors.md#purposeresult)-internal | Signal Purposes and Result; Focus only on `internal` purpose or result.                                | `as a result`, `for that purpose`, `in order to X`          |


Some category of logical connectors are subsumed under some `engagement` moves or other supplementary tags. These are summarized as follows:

| Logical connection we omit | Reason for the omission                                    | Examples                                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| concede                    | Already covered in `CONCUR`                                | `admittedly`                                         |
| adversative                | Already covered in `PROCLAIM` (e.g., `PRONOUNCE`/`CONCUR`) | `in fact`, `actually`, `as a matter of fact`         |
| alternative                | Partly overlaps with `ENTERTAIN`                           | `alternatively`                                      |
| time—ordering              | Already covered in `Text-sequencing`                       | `first`, `second`                                    |
| additive-external          |                                                            |                                                      |
| temporal-external          | external temporal expressions are out of scope.            | `today`, `on weekends`, I talked to you `previously` |
| purpose/result-external    |                                                            |                                                      |



## 2b. Text organizing devices 

- Text organizing devices includes "discourse signals" that "refers to discourse acts, sequencing, and text-stages" (or what Hyland's called `frame markers`; Hyland, 2005)
- The following tags are used when we interpret the writer's intension is to let the reader know about the organization of its own text itself (independent from the content of the argument).

| Tag                                                                    | Description                                                       | Examples                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Goal-announcing](./3_Frame_markers.md#goal-announcing)                | Signal the purpose/goals of the text itself                       | `my purpose is`, `Section 2 describes`, `the chapter/section focuses/proposes`, `we intend to`, `in this chapter` |
| [Text-sequencing/staging](./3_Frame_markers.md#text-sequencingstaging) | Signal sequences and stages of argumentative elements in the text | `First`\*, `Lastly`\*, `to start with`, `so far`, `overall`,                                                      |
| ‖—[Summative**](./3_Frame_markers.md#summative)                        | Signal summary/conclusion of a part of the text                   | `to conclude`, `in short`, `to sum up`, `The conclusion is`                                                       |

`*` in the table shows that the item's function needs to be distinguished between `logical` and `text-organizing`.
