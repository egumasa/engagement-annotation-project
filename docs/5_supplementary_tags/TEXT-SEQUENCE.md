> Text-sequencing/staging devices signal sequences and stages of argumentative elements in the text. 

There are three subcategories of markers, which we classify under this `TEXT-SEQUENCING` category.

### Sequencing

Text sequences typically signals the order of the elements to be considered in the argument. 
For example, writers may list three reasons for their argument by using sequencing: `first`, `second` and `third/last`. This is the typical use of text-sequencing devices.

Other less obvious examples include:

- `to start with` (to initiate the discussion)
- `then` (to organize the argument) 
- Listing and numbering such as `a.`, `b.`, and `c.` or `1.`, `2.`, and `3.`.
- `Firstly`, `next`, `subsequently`, `finally`, `lastly`, and similarly functioning expressions.


### Staging

Text staging typically act as a signal where the current statement stands in the overall argument.

- `so far`, `at this point`, `thus far` (to remind the reader of what has been talked about previously)
- `for the moment` (to indicate that the thesis is going to be developed in the later section)


### Topic-shifting

- `now`, `moving onto X`, `regarding X`, `back to` (to signal a shift in topic of discussion)


## Examples

- **In this section** we first describe the student participants’ reports of their experiences and their perceptions of their EAP classes, and then the teachers’ perceptions.
- **First**, a supportive online environment should enable learners to take charge of their online actions ... **Second**, resonating with previous findings ... **Finally**, to increase students’ engagement and motivation, online writing tools could incorporate popular gaming elements.
- **First**, despite its macrostructure, the RA shouldhave a separate Discussion section. **Second**, the first availabledrafts had to have been written by the students (the first authors) on their own. 
- **Returning to the more frequent referential discourse function**, normalized mean per-text counts of the subfunctions between sub-corpora are displayed in Table 7.
- We **now** look at our results in more detail, beginning with moves.


The followings are NOT examples of `Text-sequence`:

- the sample encompassed the _first, second, third, and fourth_ year candidates along with graduate students.
