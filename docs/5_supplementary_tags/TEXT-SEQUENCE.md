### Text-sequencing/staging

{: .def}
> Text-sequencing/staging devices signal sequences and stages of argumentative elements in the text. 

#### Description

##### Sequencing: 

Text sequences typically signals the order of the elements to be considered in the argument. 
For example, writers may list three reasons for their argument by using sequencing: `first`, `second` and `third/last`. This is the typical use of text-sequencing devices.

Other less obvious examples include:

- `to start with` (to initiate the discussion)
- `then` (to organize the argument) 
- Listing and numbering such as `a.`, `b.`, and `c.` or `1.`, `2.`, and `3.`.
- `Firstly`, `next`, `subsequently`, `finally`, `lastly`, and similarly functioning expressions.

##### Staging:

Text staging typically act as a signal where the current statement stands in the overall argument.

- `so far`, `at this point`, `thus far` (to remind the reader of what has been talked about previously)
- `for the moment` (to indicate that the thesis is going to be developed in the later section)
- `now`, `moving onto X`, `regarding X`, `back to` (to signal a shift in topic of discussion)
