# Under-construction

In order to better classify modal verbs into different engagement categories (`Entertain` or not), we will classify the senses of modal verb.

There are three types in modal sense classification.

| Class     | General Meaning                 | Engagement tag |
| :-------- | :------------------------------ | :------------- |
| Epistemic | probability, possibility        | ENTERTAIN      |
| Deontic   | request, permission, obligation | ENTERTAIN      |
| Dynamic   | ability, willingness, circumatance  |                |

More examples are added below later.
## Epistemic modal — Modal of probability and possibility
`Epistemic` modal can be identified "using a paraphrase such as: “someone is likely/ unlikely to do something”, or “something is likely/possible/(im)probable to happen/to be the case”" (p. 10).
- Geez, Buddha **must** be so annoyed!
- He **may** be home by now.
- Someone is knocking at the door. That **will** be John.
- This manuscript is damned hard to read. **Maybe** some more light can help.
- John **may/must** have been in his office.
- Mary **ought to / should / could** be at school by now. 

## Deontic modal — Modal of request, permission and obligation
Deontic modality has two sub-classes: request and permission.
`Request` can be identified "using as paraphrase: “need to do something” or “it is required to do something”" (p. 10).
`Permission` can be identified "using as paraphrase: “allow/don’t allow somebody to do something”"
According to Martin & White (2005), deontic modal is categorized as `Entertain`.
- We **must** have clear European standards.	(obligation)
- You **may** enter this building.	(permission)
- We **should** be thankful for what he has done for us, so we must find a way to show our gratitude to him.	(obligation)
- John **may/can** come in now. (permission)
- John **must** come in now.	(obligation)
- You **can** smoke in here.

## Dynamic modal – Modal of capability, ability, and willingness
`Dynamic` modal can be identified "using the paraphrase “be (un)able to do something”" (p. 10)

- They **ca**n’t even read them.	(ability)
- That kid **can** sing like Frank Sinatra.	(ability)
- John **will** do it for you.	(willingness)

## Confusing cases 
To be updated...
### Dynamic vs. deontic `can`
- You can do this, if you want.
  
### Epistemic vs. Dynamic `could`
- He could have arrived in time.

### Epistemic vs deontic `should` –This is less important because they will be ENTERTAIN anyway.
- He should be aware of the issue.
