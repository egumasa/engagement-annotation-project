# Primary and Secondary classification

{: .label .label-green}
New in Version 2



After identifying engagement strategies, classify them into `Primary` and `Secondary` engagement strategies.


## Primary engagement strategies

Primary engagement strategies are those that characterize the engagement of a [T-unit](1_Basic_grammar#terminal-unit-t-unit).  

- Typically, the following grammatical structures *tend to* take primary engagement strategy (but not always):
  - Main verb of a `MAIN` clause
  - Adverbial/Prepositional phrases that modify the `MAIN` clause
  - The entire adverbial clauses that modify the `MAIN` clause
  - Modal verbs in a `MAIN` clause

Consider the following monoglossic utterance:

> The best method to understand how language proficiency develops is to look at large-scale observations from various sources.

This utterance is monoglossic because the writer uses present tense 'is' to present the idea as if it is a fact. This is called a bare assertion (= `Monogloss`).


Primary engagement strategies will change the "tone" of this statement, either `expand` or `contract` the discourse, for example:

- **In my opinion (ENTERTAIN/Prepositional phrase)**, the best method to understand how language proficiency develops is to look at large-scale observations from various sources.
- **Perhaps (ENTERTAIN/Adverb)**, the best method to understand how language proficiency develops be to look at large-scale observations from various sources.
- The best method to understand how language proficiency develops **would (ENTERTAIN/Modal verb)** be to look at large-scale observations from various sources.
- Researchers **proposed (ATTRIBUTE/Main verb)** that the best method to understand how language proficiency develops is to look at large-scale observations from various sources.
- **Although it takes a great amount of effort (COUNTER/adverbial clause)**, the best method to understand how language proficiency develops is to look at large-scale observations from various sources.

#### MONOGLOSS should be used when JUSTIFY and CITATION is the only other moves.

Because `Justify` and `Citation` is treated as auxiliary engagement moves, we will tag `MONOGLOSS` to indicate that the sentence itself is presented `monoglossic`. For example:

- I **decided (MONOGLOSS)** to writer a letter to the author **because the figure contained an error (JUSTIFY)**.

The reason for this is that `Justify` and `Citation` is not determine the engagement of the whole clause (they are neither `expand` or `contract` the discourse).

## Secondary engagement strategies

Secondary engagement strategies usually occurs in the `EMBEDDED` or `SUBORDINATE` clauses. This is because embedded and subordinate clauses are categorized as dependent unit to `MAIN` clause.
They do not affect the overall engagement strategy of the sentence, but still contribute to the discourse to some extent.

Even the primary strategy is monoglossic, the sentence can still have secondary engagement strategies.

- The best method to understand how language proficiency **may (ENTERTAIN)** develop **is (MONOGLOSS)** to look at large-scale observations from various sources.

In this example, the primary engagement strategy is monoglossic because there is no engagement resources that satisfies the criteria of primary engagement strategy defined above. However, it still has a modal verb (may) in an `EMBEDDED` clause. This modal very takes on secondary engagement (or `ENTERTAIN` category) in the sentence. It does not influence the overall clausal strategy, but still be considered entertaining the presupposed idea of the sentence.
