# Primary and Secondary classification

{: .label .label-green}
New in Version 2


After identifying engagement strategies, classify them into `Primary` and `Secondary` engagement strategies.


## Primary engagement strategies

Primary engagement strategies are those that characterize the engagement of a `MAIN` clause. 
As a rough guideline, these are constructions with an engagement meaning (a) occuring within the `MAIN` clause but not in an `EMBEDDED` clause OR (b) corresponding to the span of a `SUBORDINATE` clause.

Consider the following monoglossic utterance:

> The best method to understand how language proficiency develops is to look at large-scale observations from various sources.

This utterance is monoglossic because the writer uses present tense 'is' to present the idea as if it is a fact. This is called a bare assertion (= `Monogloss`).

Primary engagement strategies will change the "tone" of this statement, either `expand` or `contract` the discourse:

- **In my opinion (ENTERTAIN)**, the best method to understand how language proficiency develops is to look at large-scale observations from various sources.
- **Perhaps (ENTERTAIN)**, the best method to understand how language proficiency develops be to look at large-scale observations from various sources.
- The best method to understand how language proficiency develops **would (ENTERTAIN)** be to look at large-scale observations from various sources.
- Researchers **proposed (ATTRIBUTE)** that the best method to understand how language proficiency develops is to look at large-scale observations from various sources.
- **Although it takes a great amount of effort (COUNTER)**, the best method to understand how language proficiency develops is to look at large-scale observations from various sources.

#### MONOGLOSS should be used when JUSTIFY and CITATION is the only other moves.

Because `Justify` and `Citation` is treated as auxiliary engagement moves, we will tag `MONOGLOSS` to indicate that the sentence itself is presented `monoglossic`. For example:

- I **decided (MONOGLOSS)** to writer a letter to the author **because the figure contained an error (JUSTIFY)**.

The reason for this is that `Justify` and `Citation` is not determine the engagement of the whole clause (they are neither `expand` or `contract` the discourse).

## Secondary engagement strategies

Secondary engagement strategies occur in the `EMBEDDED` or `SUBORDINATE` clauses. They do not affect the overall engagement strategy of the sentence, but still contribute to the discourse to some extent.

Even the primary strategy is monoglossic, the sentence can still have secondary engagement strategies.

- The best method to understand how language proficiency **may (ENTERTAIN)** develop **is (MONOGLOSS)** to look at large-scale observations from various sources.

In this example, the primary engagement strategy is monoglossic because there is no engagement resources that satisfies the criteria of primary engagement strategy defined above. However, it still has a modal verb (may) in an `EMBEDDED` clause. This modal very takes on secondary engagement (or `ENTERTAIN` category) in the sentence. It does not influence the overall clausal strategy, but still be considered entertaining the presupposed idea of the sentence.
