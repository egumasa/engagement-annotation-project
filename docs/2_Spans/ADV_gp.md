## Subordinate clause—including both single-word and multi-word subordinate conjunctions

Common subordinate conjunctions, which introduce a subordinate clause, include:
- **Concessions**: although, as, as though, even, even though, though, just as though, whereas, while
- **Conditions**: even if, if, in case, provided (that), unless, as long as, as much as, as far as,
- **Temporal**: after, as, as soon as, as long as, before, once, since, still, till, until, when, whenever, while
- **Contrasts**: although, though, whereas, while, rather than, 
- **Causal relations**: as, because, in order (that), so that, now that, since
  
Note that the meaning of the subordinating conjunction depends on the context. 

{: .caution}
Some semantic categories of subordinate clauses (e.g., concession, Conditions) are closely related to some of the engagement meaning. For example, concessions are likely to associate with `COUNTER`, and Conditions with `ENTERTAIN`. Some causal conjunctions are related to `JUSTIFY`. Remember not all semantic categories are used as Engagement resource, nor not all instances of closely related categories just mentioned (e.g., concession, conditions) take on engagement value.
