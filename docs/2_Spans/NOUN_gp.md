## Shell nouns/ Nominalized construction


Shell nouns are abstract nouns that are frequently used to express **mental or communicative processes** in a compressed fashion.

For example;
- Chomsky believes that language is for individuals rather than group. 

Can be paraphrased using shell noun `belief` as follows:

- **Chomsky’s belief** that language is for individuals rather than groups .


Sometimes primary and more typically secondary engagement value is expressed using a nominalized construction. As per the pattern for verbal group, we do NOT include the clause-controlling `that` in the span (although discriptively and psycholinguistically they may behave as one unit).


- **Chomsky’s belief** that language is for individuals rather than groups .
- First of all, we see no problem with **their proposal** that John take over the running of the EEC Intensive Foundation Summer School at Bentham House, especially if this arrangement is more beneficial to the Laws Faculty.
- They deny **the possibility of** a death wish lurking amidst the gardens of lust.
- **My impression** that I had been hurled into a coarsu world was heightened at the beginning of each day.

## No + noun construction

- **No claims** can be made for more than inferential findings.
- Without variability, **no learning** can take place.
