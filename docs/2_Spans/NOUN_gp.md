NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

Shell nouns are abstract nouns that are frequently used to express **mental or communicative processes** in a compressed fashion.

For example;
- Chomsky believes that language is for individuals rather than group. 

Can be paraphrased using shell noun `belief` as follows:

- **Chomsky’s belief that** language is for individuals rather than groups .


Sometimes primary and more typically secondary engagement value is expressed using a nominalized construction.
- **Chomsky’s belief** that language is for individuals rather than groups .
- First of all, we see no problem with **their proposal that** John take over the running of the EEC Intensive Foundation Summer School at Bentham House, especially if this arrangement is more beneficial to the Laws Faculty.
- **I am of the opinion that** somebody is going to wake up suddenly and demand aluminum which means a demand for power.
- They deny **the possibility of** a death wish lurking amidst the gardens of lust.
- **My impression that** I had been hurled into a coarsu world was heightened at the beginning of each day.
