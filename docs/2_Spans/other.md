## Questions

When an engagement meaning is realized by a question, we will tag the whole question **INCLUDING the question mark**. This will result in **not completely overlapping span** for clause detection and engagement because clause detection does not include punctuation at the end of the clause.

## Comment clause/parataxis

- Well, I'm going to feel lucky if my car isn't towed, **I think**.
- The conclusion, **it seems**, is intolerable. (Treated as `primary` engagement)
- He is in hospital here, **I think**.
