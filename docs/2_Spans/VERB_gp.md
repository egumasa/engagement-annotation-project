## Verb phrases

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

When an engagement meaning is realized by a verb phrase, you will put a tag on the entire verb phrase (including Auxiliary + negation + lexical verbs + particles).
One exception to note is when a [modal auxiliary](#modal-verbs) is in the verb phrase. In such cases, we will treat the modal verb separately from the verb phrase.

- Discussants correctly **pointed out** that Bernardino of Siena, Martin Le Franc, and the anonymous author of the Errores Gazariorum all **have** an even more aggressive campaign against witches than **did** the authors of our previous readings.
- They **have found** it very difficult to understand each other ‘s lifestyles.

When there are `negative perticles (e.g., not, never)` we will still consider it within the span.
- Even though he **had taken** all his medication, his leg **did n’t look** any better.
- The effect of Morphological Awareness **did not achieve** significance ( β = .193, p = .263).

>Previously (in version 1), we have put a tag on "most lexically heavy verbs".

## Passive construction

{: .label .label-green}
New in Version 2

When we put a tag on passive construction (e.g., `MONOGLOSS`, `ATTRIBUTE`), we include `copula verb + lexical verb` in the span.

- The allegations **are believed** to involve several teenagen aged from 12 to 18.

## Modal verbs

When an engagement meaning is realized by a modal verbs (e.g., can, may, might, have to, etc.), you will put a tag on the modal.
- He **may** be lying.
- Teachers **should** show students the language needed to achieve these rhetorical features of argumentative writing.

- needn't, don't need to, don't have to, won't, wouldn't, shouldn't, (isn't/wasn't), mustn't, oughtn't to, can't, couldn't, (mayn't, mightn't, haven't to).

## degree adverb + lexical verb

NEW in version 2.1 
{: .label .label-green}

When there is a degree adverb that directly modify the lexical verb that expresses ENGAGEMENT meaning, then we consider these two as a set of engagement move.

- I **partially agree** with the statement above.
- He **completely opposed** to the report.


## Emphatic do

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

A typical realization of `PRONOUNCE` is the use of emphatic do. In this case, we will put a tag on `do + lexical verb`:

- We `do believe` that researchers should view this disciplinary division as an opportunity rather than an obstacle.

This is a strategy to prevent any `ENTERTAIN` tagged on `believe` when there is already a `PRONOUNCE` in the sentence.
