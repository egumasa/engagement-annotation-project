## Other verb phrases—

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

When an engagement meaning is realized by a verb phrase, you will put a tag on the entire verb phrase (including Auxiliary + negation + lexical verbs + particles).
One exception to note is when a [modal auxiliary](#modal-verbs) is in the verb phrase. In such cases, we will treat the modal verb separately from the verb phrase.

- They **have found** it very difficult to understand each other ‘s lifestyles.
- Discussants correctly **pointed out** that Bernardino of Siena, Martin Le Franc, and the anonymous author of the Errores Gazariorum all **have** an even more aggressive campaign against witches than **did** the authors of our previous readings.
When there are `negative perticles (e.g., not, never)` we will still consider it within the span.
- Even though he **had taken** all his medication, his leg **did n’t look** any better.
- The effect of Morphological Awareness **did not achieve** significance ( β = .193, p = .263).

## Passive construction

{: .label .label-green}
New in Version 2

When we put a tag on passive construction (e.g., `MONOGLOSS`, `ATTRIBUTE`), we include `copula verb + lexical verb` in the span.


- The data **was collected** in the local community.
- The allegations **are believed** to involve several teenagen aged from 12 to 18.
- At least some of the abuse **is claimed** to have taken place last year.
- It **was expected** that they would interview him later today.

## degree adverb + lexical verb

NEW in version 2.1 
{: .label .label-green}

When there is a degree adverb that directly modify the lexical verb that expresses ENGAGEMENT meaning, then we consider these two as a set of engagement move.

- I **partially agree** with the statement above.
- He **completely opposed** to the report.




## It is X that/to— as Interpersonal metaphor

Updated in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

When there is `It is X that ~`, `It is X to ~` or `there is/are X that` construction, we will tag the entire span of this construction. 
This decision is based on the fact that these construction function as introducing the stance of the writer as a whole (they almost function as chunks). 

When the `that-clause` govern the following clause, the tag spans are from `It/There` to `that`:
- **It’s probable/likely/possible that** he’s lying.
- **It is possible that** it is your duty to tell me.
- **It is absolutely clear to me that** what Charlotte was arguing was that Crouching Tiger was a bad film to which liberal audiences imputed a significance shaped by their own prejudices about Chinese cinema and the Chinese in general.
- **There is no doubt that** globalization has a deep effect on China.
- However, **there is mounting evidence that** processes of language acquisition, use, and change are not independent of one another but are facets of the same system.
- **There can be no doubt, however, that** the imperial Byzantine silks have a power and a dignity, a feeling for design and texture, seldom rivalled in the history of textiles.
- **It is said that** television keeps people at home. 

When a `to-infinitive` govern the following clause, the tag spans are from `It` to the adjectival complement.
- **It is possible** for a layer of ice to form under the circumstances.
- But **it is likely** to have an impact in the near future.
- It was found, for example, that **it is more likely** to occur in NNS–NNS dyads rather than between NSs and NNSs (Varonis & Gass, 1985 ).
- **It would be possible** to suppose, for instance, that the tnre Schrodinger-like equation involves non-linearities.



In the following pattern, we can identify two strategies.
- It seems fairly obvious to most people that Watson tremendously oversimplified the learning process.

First, `It seems fairly obvious` gets a span, because this is a variant of `It is X to`.
Second, `seems` should get another tag because they add `ENTERTAIN` value to the author's assessment using `fairly obvious`.

- **It *seems* fairly obvious** to most people that Watson tremendously oversimplified the learning process.

## I am X that/whether/how ~

Updated in version 2
{: .label .label-green}


- I am sure that
- I have no doubt that 
- I am not entirely sure whether
- I am of the opinion that



## Modal verbs

When an engagement meaning is realized by a modal verbs (e.g., can, may, might, have to, etc.), you will put a tag on the modal.
- He **may** be lying.
- Teachers **should** show students the language needed to achieve these rhetorical features of argumentative writing.

![modal](figures/spans/modals.png)

### List of modal verbs

Following Halliday & Mathiessen (2014, p. 145), the following items are considered as modal verbs (Modal operators) in this project:
- can, may, could, might, (dare), will, would, should, is to, was to, must, ought to, need to, have/has/had to
- needn't, don't need to, don't have to, won't, wouldn't, shouldn't, (isn't/wasn't), mustn't, oughtn't to, can't, couldn't, (mayn't, mightn't, haven't to).


## Emphatic do

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

A typical realization of `PRONOUNCE` is the use of emphatic do. In this case, we will put a tag on `do + lexical verb`:

- We `do believe` that researchers should view this disciplinary division as an opportunity rather than an obstacle.

This is a strategy to prevent any `ENTERTAIN` tagged on `believe` when there is already a `PRONOUNCE` in the sentence.
