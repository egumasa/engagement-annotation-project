## Grammatical terminology
First of all, it is always helpful to clarify important terminologies we will use during the annotation project. When I use the following terms, I use in the following meaning and examples in mind.

| Terminology               | Definition/Description                                                                                                                                | Example                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| phrase/constituents       | A group of words which function together (creates meaning).                                                                                           | The impatient customer (NP)/was acting (VP) /very cranky (ADV) /at the time (PP). |
| clause                    | Linguistic unit containing a verb (and typically a subject).                                                                                          | I went to the park yesterday. / Be mindful.                                       |
| independent (main) clause | A clause that can stand alone to make a complete sentence                                                                                             | (The two example above are independent clause and sentence themselves.)           |
| dependent clause          | A clause that are attached to (dependent on) an independent clause.                                                                                   | If you are free (dep. cl), just come to the party (ind. cl).                      |
| subordinate clause        | A dependent clause that is attached to a main clause through the use of subordinate conjunctions (e.g., because, although, if, when, as, while, etc.) |                                                                                   |
| embedded clause           | A type of dependent clause that function as a part of another clause.                                                                                 |                                                                                   |
| ROOT                      | The highest node in the syntactic tree of a sentence.                                                                                                 |                                                                                   |
| head                      | The highest node in the given a phrase/constituent/clause                                                                                             |                                                                                   |

## Distinguishing adverbial clauses and adverbial phrases

As of April 9th, we decided to put a tag on the whole subordinate clause. This means that we do not really have to distinguish these two.
In the following example, adverbial phrases and clauses are contrasted. 

### Adverbial phrases

| Adverbial phrase                                                 | Else                                                         |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Yesterday**                                                    | I went to the market.                                        |
| **Despite the rain**,                                            | the Cub Scouts held the car wash.                            |
| **Before/After the play**,                                       | we had coffee.                                               |
| **Since Monday**,                                                | it has been terribly hot.                                    |
| **Because of the small size of the self‐reflection sub‐corpus**, | we have excluded it from our analysis across academic level. |

### Adverbial clauses


| Adverbial clause                           | Else                                                                                    |
| :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Because this is a new annotation task**, | clarification from the annotator greatly helps.                                         |
| **As we mentioned in Chapter I**,          | however, we believe that it is better to conceive of grammar and lexicon as intertwined |
| **Before/After the play ended**,           | many patrons were crying.                                                               |
| **Since you talked to me about it**,       | I've become convinced.                                                                  |
