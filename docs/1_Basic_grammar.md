## Grammatical terminology
First of all, it is always helpful to clarify important terminologies we will use during the annotation project. When I use the following terms, I use in the following meaning and examples in mind.

| Terminology               | Definition/Description                                                                                                                                | Example                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| phrase/constituents       | A group of words which function together (creates meaning).                                                                                           | The impatient customer (NP)/was acting (VP) /very cranky (ADV) /at the time (PP). |
| clause                    | Linguistic unit containing a verb (and typically a subject).                                                                                          | I went to the park yesterday. / Be mindful.                                       |
| independent (main) clause | A clause that can stand alone to make a complete sentence                                                                                             | (The two example above are independent clause and sentence themselves.)           |
| dependent clause          | A clause that are attached to (dependent on) an independent clause.                                                                                   | If you are free (dep. cl), just come to the party (ind. cl).                      |
| subordinate clause        | A dependent clause that is attached to a main clause through the use of subordinate conjunctions (e.g., because, although, if, when, as, while, etc.) |                                                                                   |
| embedded clause           | A type of dependent clause that function as a part of another clause.                                                                                 |                                                                                   |
| ROOT                      | The highest node in the syntactic tree of a sentence.                                                                                                 |                                                                                   |
| head                      | The highest node in the given a phrase/constituent/clause                                                                                             |                                                                                   |



## Coordinated clauses vs Subordinate clauses vs Embedded clause

### Coordinated clauses
Coordinated clauses are independent clauses that are connected with coordinating conjunction (e.g., `and`, `but`, `or`).

| Independent clause            | Coordinated conjunction | Independent clause                  |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Marianne lives in California, | but                     | Diane lives in Michigan or Vermont. |
| He went to the party,         | but                     | I stayed home.                      |

### Subordinate clauses
A subordinate clause is a dependent clause that is attached to a main clause through the use of subordinate conjunctions (e.g., `because`, `although`, `if`, `when`, `as`, `while`, etc.)

A subordinate clause can either follow or preceed the main clause. ~~We will come back to this later, but when we put a tag on subordinate clause, it will fall onto the conjunction.~~
As of April 9th, we decided to put a tag on the entire subordinate clause (**Bolded**).

| Main clause                          | Subordinate clause                      |
| :----------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| It was hard to write a book together | **because they live so far apart**.     |
| Peggy frequently calls               | **because she wants to stay in touch**. |

| Subordinate clause                              | Main clause                            |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **Although Marianne and Diane live far apart**, | they are still friends.                |
| **As far as I am concerned**,                   | there is not much study on this topic. |


### Embedded clauses
An embedded clause is a type of dependent clause that function as a part of another clause. That is, an embedded clause is included in a subject, object of another clause (i.e., complement clause) or function as an adjective to modify a noun (i.e., relative clause).
In the following examples, embedded clauses are _italicized_.

- The paper argued _[that average price is not a meaningful measure of market power]_. (The clause functions as an object of argue.)
- I wanna eat the ramen _[that she mentioned a couple of days ago]_. (The clause modifies "the ramen".)
- And you will meet a man _[who says American Airlines took away his life]_. (The clause modifies "a man".)
- The idea _[that a democratic school is one where kids have an equal vote]_, I think, is a mistake. (The clause is a complement of a noun.)

## Distinguishing adverbial clauses and adverbial phrases

~~One tricky grammatical detail that becomes important during annotation is the distinction between adverbial clauses and phrases.
As we will see, we are going to tag the entire phrase (such as `in my view`, `for example`, `as for me`), but we will put a tag on the conjunction (e.g., `as`, `because`, `when`) not the entire clause.
A clause has to have `finite` verb (roughly verb with tense) while a phrase does not have finite verbs (or even lacks a verb).~~

As of April 9th, we decided to put a tag on the whole subordinate clause. This means that we do not really have to distinguish these two.

### Adverbial phrases


| Adverbial phrase      | Else                              |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| **Yesterday**         | I went to the market.             |
| **Despite the rain**, | the Cub Scouts held the car wash. |


### Adverbial clauses

| Adverbial clause                           | Else                                                                                    |
| :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Because this is a new annotation task**, | clarification from the annotator greatly helps.                                         |
| **As we mentioned in Chapter I**,          | however, we believe that it is better to conceive of grammar and lexicon as intertwined |
