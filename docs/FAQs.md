# FAQs
This page list some FAQs, which have or have not been incorporated to the main guideline.

## Contents within direct quotes does not get an engagement tag.
This is because the content within a direct quotations (" ") are not author's view, but the content on which the authors are supposed to take their stance on.
For example:
> **According to Habermas (ATTRIBUTE)**, "the public sphere in the political realm evolved from the public sphere in the world of letters, through the vehicle of public opinion it put the state in touch with the needs of society."

-> The content within the direct quote (i.e., "the public sphere ... ) does not get any tags.

## Does "in addition" recieve any tags?

It is unlikely that transitional phrases (particularly "additions") would recieve engagement meaning.
- In addition,
- Additionally,
- Thus,
- Therefore,

But you will tag `Counter` for transitional phrases that counter the positions.
- But,
- However, 
- Yet, 
- etc.


## What about `in conclusion` as potential pronounce device...?

## Issues around embedded clauses
This is a recurrent issue that should be addressed. Some examples to consider includes...
- `BIOTEC/NBC, DOA, and FDA, are already <engmt class="monogloss">assigned</engmt> these tasks, respectively, it is <engmt class="entertain">likely</engmt> that serious implementation problems would occur.`
- `Smoking <engmt class="entertain">will</engmt> help global warming occurs, <engmt class="justify">because the smoke composition can help the effect of greenhouse effect that will warm the earth temperatures</engmt>.`
- `After its release, critics <engmt class="attribute">applauded</engmt> Entineâ€™s careful review of Jewish history and culture, <engmt class="counter">though</engmt> some admitted that despite his best efforts, "In his attempt to give us a full picture of the events comprising Jewish history, the author sometimes wanders." <span class="citation">[#REF 82]</span>`
=> This `despite` phrase is in the presupposed content.
- `These notions <engmt class="monogloss">include</engmt> an issue on whether the IUCN should encourage a moratorium on further release of GMOs, or help establish a sound body of knowledge on environmental risks and impacts.`
=> `issue on whether` introduces the content itself.
- `The purpose of maintaining an expansive approach here **is** clear: the author **seeks** to present perspectives and research **conducted** thus far to lay the groundwork for what should be done.`


## Problems in the sentence segmentation

Sometimes, the annotation dataset may have weird lines. This may include completely empty lines, or just a word in line. It can also have cases where in-text citations are ill-formatted.
Here are what I would like you to do:

### In-text citations
Consider the following fragmented citations as `CITATION`
- The extremely high prevalence of child and adolescent exposure to violence in U.S. inner-cities <engmt class="monogloss">is</engmt> alarming **(Bell &amp;amp**.
- 
## Is `otherwise` disclaim:counter...?
- `Choosing appropriate types of part-time job <engmt class="monogloss">is</engmt> important too, otherwise students <engmt class="entertain">may</engmt> fall into traps setup by companies with problems.`


## Some other examples to consider
- `The transitions from winter to summer also <engmt class="monogloss">show</engmt> an increase in feeding of fruits, flowers, bark, and seeds.`
