### Proclaim: Pronounce

CONTRACTION
{: .label .label-yellow }

{: .def}
>An utterance which expresses a strong level of writer commitment through the author's explicit emphasis and interpolation.

In pronounce, the writer shows strong commitment that their idea is TRUE. Reader would consider that this is a very bold move.
Pronounce is where you 
- _I **contend**_ it's the worst address by a British Prime Minister.
- _I **insist** that_ she's the person for the job.
- _I would **contend** that_ this enviable level of tolerance is not the result of direct government laws or interventions.
- _I would **affirm**_ the judgment of the trail court and deny the motion to suppress Oliver’s statement.
- **It is absolutely clear to me** that what Charlotte was arguing was that Crouching Tiger was a bad film to which liberal audiences imputed a significance shaped by their own prejudices about Chinese cinema and the Chinese in general.
- **It is evident that** a powerful political - industrial complex with a developmentalist ideology remains the greatest threat to the environment of Taiwan .
- _I therefore **propose** that_ universities have a greater role in working alongside the NCAA in negotiating its television.
- One of the arrested people **in fact** was a Hindu, a chef from Hong Kong.
- _We have to **remember** that_ bobbies move around - and slowly.
- _The absolute **fact** is that_ linguistics is fun.
- _But the **facts** of the matter are that_ we have never made the national decisions or marshaled the national resources required for such leadership.
- The scare was enough to close the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong for a day, though the men **turned out** to be tourists
- **There is no doubt that** globalization has a deep effect on China.
- I _**DID**_ turn out the lights before I left.
- However, **there is mounting evidence that** processes of language acquisition, use, and change are not independent of one another but are facets of the same system.

- _We firmly **believe**_ deepwater drilling can be done safely and in an environmentally sensitive manner.
  - Note: firmly here intensifies and increases the commitment by the author, so we consider them as `Pronounce` rather than `Entertain`.
- 


Pronounce is also realized by **intensifiers with clausal scope** such as `really`, `indeed`, etc.
- I **really** think that it is true.
- **Indeed**, a binary definition of the environment increases the strength of spatial relations and the measure of spatial autocorrelation. 
- The language spoken at that period is **undoubtedly** called Middle English, which is sandwiched in‑between by Old English and Modern English. (Note: undoutedly expresses authors committment to their assersion.)
- In this way the company can **definitely** fulfil the fluctuating demand. (Note: definitely carries the author's subjective involvement to the company's capacity.)

**What's NOT pronounce?**

Although the author may show "assessment of high probability" (e.g., He **must** be lying.; I'm **convinced** that he is lying), these are still expansive.
So, these are still classified as ENTERTAIN. In other words, even if the percieved probability is high, they still present it as one of the potential alternative views (ENTERTAIN).
Martin and White (2005) writes:

>Accordingly, as assessments of probability, such modals are dialogically expansive – they still ‘entertain’ the possibility of dialogistical alternatives. Pronouncements, in contrast, do not ‘entertain’ alternative positions in this way but, as we have demonstrated, are directed towards challenging and dismissing an alternative viewpoint.
