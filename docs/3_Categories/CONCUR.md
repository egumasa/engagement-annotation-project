### Proclaim: Concur

CONTRACTION
{: .label .label-yellow }

{: .def}
>An utterance which shows writers' expectation for the putative readers to agree with the preposition and/or to have the same knowledge.

This includes lexico-grammatical items such as `naturally`, `if course`, `obviously`, `admittedly`. These items reveal writer's expectation for the reader to agree with the idea.

There are two sub-types of `concur` which we do not differentiate in the current project. These are `affirm` and `concede` (Tan, 2010).  

`Affirm` examples
- The ability of a population to successfully reproduce is **obviously** a crucial aspect of a society’s survival.
- Bailey, **of course**, was that rarity, a cricketer who at his best was worldclass with both bat and ball.
- The Bush administration, **as we all know**, has rejected the Kyoto agreement
- **As we can see**, the popularity of Woodlands new town between residents and non-residents is directly opposite to each other.
- Furthermore , **we can easily see** that the semantic overdetermination of the Pygmalion story is already there , as J. Hillis Miller sees , in Ovid .
- _Everyone **knows** that_ linguistics is fun.
- I **know** Inspector Morse was _supposed (ATTRIBUTE)_ to be the pinnacle of the late John Thaw’s career.

`Concede` examples
- **Admittedly**, he was badly behaved.
- **Indeed**, it is odd that both the FTC and courts have historically regarded huge, publicly traded insurance firms rather than health providers as the legal proxy of patients.
- **Sure**, he broke rules.
- If, **as all the pundits are saying**, there is no hope of normalcy returning soon

Some tricky example, but we all categorize them under `concur`:
- **Certainly** he was badly behaved but look at what he has achieved.

{: .note }
**Certainly** illustrates there may be multiple functions that an item can accomplish depending on the context. Here, "Certainly ...., but" can be considered as `concur`, but certainly can be used as `Entertain` (see example).

Rhetorical questions are sometimes categorized as `Concur`:
- **Should we go to war against these children? (CONCUR)** (Tip: Tag the entire question.)

See [Rhetorical questions](../3_Categories/confusing_tags.md/#rhetorical-questions) for other possibilities.
