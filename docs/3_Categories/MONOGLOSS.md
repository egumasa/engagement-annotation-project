### Monogloss

{: .def}
>An utterance which does not employ any value of engagement. Such an utterance ignores the dialogic potential in an utterance.

Examine this fact in the following examples, where there should be no engagement-invoking lexico-grammatical items in each sentence.

When there is no engagement-invoking items in the MAIN clause, we will consider it as `MONOGLOSS—Primary`. These are marked using **Bold-face** in the following examples.

We will also use `MONOGLOSS—Secondary` to mark any MONOGLOSS-ic verbs in SUBORDINATE or EMBEDDED clauses. These are marked using *Italics*.


#### Examples
- Teachers **are facing** the difficult task of providing an optimal learning environment to students from varying social, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds.
- What *is* interesting in this example **is** how neither of the two views that *are attributed* to others is actually endorsed by the author, even though they are entertained and explicated.
- The purpose of maintaining an expansive approach here **is** clear: the author **seeks** to present perspectives and research conducted thus far to lay the groundwork for what should be done.
- Television **has helped** to shrink the relative distance between people and countries.
- When the news *came* through that the National Air Traffic Services (Nats) *was* in financial trouble and *was being offered* a £60 million rescue package, the reaction of the first union official to pop up on the BBC’s radar screen **was** predictable.
- The preposterous idea that privatisation *puts* profit before safety *was* a commonplace long before Nats **was born**.
- In the past few years there **have been** a number of moral panics about racism, accompanied by self-serving calls from predictable quarters for more government action to deal with the problem.

An imperative clause is also classified as monogloss (Martin & White, 2005, p.111):
- Turn out (MONOGLOSSS) the lights before you leave.

### No MONOGLOSS tag on the main verb of the main/subordinate/embedded clause when you have any other engagement resources characterizing that T-unit.

- **As we can see**, the popularity of Woodlands new town between residents and non-residents is directly opposite to each other. (No MONOGLOSS tag on the main verb, "is")
- There is **nothing** wrong with your proposal. (No MONOGLOSS tag on "is")
- _**According to the authors**_, he gave new witches everything they wished as long as they sold their soul to him. (No MONOGLOSS tag on "gave")

### Other stuff

Note that modal verbs to express obligations (should, must) are categorized as `Entertain`:
- You **must (ENTERTAIN)** turn out the lights before you leave

These example are said to include no recognition of alternative viewpoints. That is, the writers treat the idea as an *established fact* at least in the sentence (i.e., bare assertion). It is also possible to say that these `monoglossic` sentences do **NOT** have any engagement items. 
To test if the sentence is monogloss, you can try adding any engagement items, for example:
- _The author **argued** that (ATTRIBUTE)_ television has helped to shrink the relative distance between people and countries.
- _Television can be **said (ATTRIBUTE)**_ to have helped to shrink the relative distance between people and countries.
- **In some regions (ENTERTAIN)**, television has helped to shrink the relative distance between people and countries.
