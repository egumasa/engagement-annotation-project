| Strategy    | Engagement moves                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Contraction | [Disclaim: Deny](DENY.md)                      | An utterance which invokes a contrary position but which at the same time rejects it directly. The contrary position is hence given very little dialogic space.                                                                      |
| Contraction | [Disclaim: Counter](COUNTER.md)                | An utterance which expresses the present proposition as replacing and thus 'countering' another proposition which would have been expected.                                                                                          |
| Contraction | [Proclaim: Concur](CONCUR.md)                  | An utterance which shows writers' expectation/assumption that the putative readers will agree with the preposition and/or to have the same knowledge.                                                                                |
| Contraction | [Proclaim: Pronounce](PRONOUNCE.md)            | An utterance which expresses a strong level of writer commitment through the author's explicit emphasis and interpolation, thereby closing down the dialogic space.                                                                  |
| Contraction | [Proclaim: Endorse](ENDORSE.md)                | An utterance which refers to external sources as warrantable, undeniable,  and/or reliable. It expresses the writer’s alignment with and endorsement of an attributed proposition. As such, the dialogic space is somewhat narrowed. |
| Expansion   | [Entertain](ENTERTAIN.md)                      | An utterance which indicates author's position but as only one possibility amongst others, thereby opening up dialogic space.                                                                                                        |
| Expansion   | [Attribute](ATTRIBUTE.md)                      | An utterance which signifies dialogic space as the writer attributes the proposition to an external source.                                                                                                                          |
| Monogloss   | [Monogloss](MONOGLOSS.md)                      | An utterance which does not employ any value of engagement. Such an utterance ignores the dialogic potential in an utterance.                                                                                                        |
| Auxiliary   | [Justify](JUSTIFY.md)                          | An utterance which engage in persuasion through justification or substantiation.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Auxiliary   | [Citations](CITATION.md) (Updated on Feb 25th) | Citation is segment of the text where external source(s) are referenced in the text.                                                                                                                                                 |
