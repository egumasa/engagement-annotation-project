## Disclaim: Deny

CONTRACTION
{: .label .label-yellow }

{: .def}
>An utterance which invokes a contrary position but which at the same time rejects it directly. The contrary position is hence given very little dialogic space.

In other words, `deny` move includes acknowledgement to an alternative position so as to reject it. Typically the meaning is realized using negations.

### DENY-specific span guideline

Typically, `DENY` is realized by negative particles in English such as `not`, `never`, and `no`.

Most frequently, this is attached to verb phrases, but it can also be attached to nominal or adverbial phrases.

#### be-verbs constructions

When `DENY` occurs in be-verb constuction, the span is mostly on `(auxiliary verb) + be-verb + (adverbial) + negative particle`.
- Linguistics **is not** easy.
- But everything that was written in your advertisement **wasn't** true at all.
- these **were definitely not** the norm.
- He liked to cut down wood for heating and selling purposes and, reputedly, if he would have had a chainsaw, there would **not have been** a tree left standing on the property (Catherine Reed 2008).

#### lexical verbs
When `DENY` occures in other verb phrases, the span is mostly on `auxiliary verb (excluding modals) + negative particle + lexical verbs`.

- The author **did not provide** any information about the method.
- Gestational age seems to be pretty much constant in terms of IQ, suggesting this variable **does not have** any effect.
- The Space Shuttle **has not met** any of the original requirements including reliability, maintainability, cost, or safety.
- This may **not require** any additional information.
- Secondly, a university graduate can**not fit** all the requirements that the employers need.


#### Nominal Constructions

When `DENY` occurs within the nominal construction, the span is from `negative particle` to `the head noun`.

- You know, smoking just make people feel boring but **no benefits**.
- In google, there's **no special rights** for anyone in the company.
- Although **no such statistics** exist for the United States , we can assume a percentage of this population is also unsure how HIV is transmitted.

### Tagging `not only` as [COUNTER](2_Part1_Understanding_Engagement.md#disclaim-counter)


{: .tips}
> We will treat following expressions as `COUNTER` not `DENY`:
> - `not only`
> - `not just`
> The reason for this decision is that we found that `not only` does not always paired with `but also` but still works just like a `COUNTER` move. This indicates that `not only` is a multiword expression that has potential to `COUNTER` the discourse by itself.


### Tagging negative prefixes such as `un-`, `non-`

When you encounter negative prefixes, consider whether that negative prefix negates the predicates (propositions).
Some example of you could tag them as `DENY` include:

- As a result , **it is unable to** come up with enough gas to meet internal demand and its export obligations.
- **It is impossible to** see the ultimate goals of either side being realized .

But the same word may not take `DENY` move because they do NOT disclaim a view point.
- The net result appears to be that these incomplete theories often portray minority children and their families as educationally inferior and _unable_ to benefit from traditional mental health practices .

In this example, `unable` is used to describe a percieved property of minority families by what the writer terms as incomplete theory. It does NOT DENY the proposition itself.

- The reporting for JE laboratory testing was vague and _incomplete_ .
This is also another example of non-DENY negative prefix.

- But it would have been an _impossible_ task without the assistance and advice of the Exhibition Webmaster.

Here, the word "impossible" describes a property of a task. The writer then ENTERTAINs this property by "would have been", making the overall engagement move as `ENTERTAIN`, not `DENY`.
