| Strategy    | Engagement moves                                                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Contraction | [Disclaim: Deny](2_Part1_Understanding_Engagement.md#disclaim-deny)                                  | An utterance which invokes a contrary position but which at the same time rejects it directly. The contrary position is hence given very little dialogic space.                                                                      |
| Contraction | [Disclaim: Counter](2_Part1_Understanding_Engagement.md#disclaim-counter)                            | An utterance which expresses the present proposition as replacing and thus 'countering' another proposition which would have been expected.                                                                                          |
| Contraction | [Proclaim: Concur](2_Part1_Understanding_Engagement.md#proclaim-concur)                              | An utterance which shows writers' expectation/assumption that the putative readers will agree with the preposition and/or to have the same knowledge.                                                                                |
| Contraction | [Proclaim: Pronounce](2_Part1_Understanding_Engagement.md#proclaim-pronounce)                        | An utterance which expresses a strong level of writer commitment through the author's explicit emphasis and interpolation, thereby closing down the dialogic space.                                                                  |
| Contraction | [Proclaim: Endorse](2_Part1_Understanding_Engagement.md#proclaim-endorse)                            | An utterance which refers to external sources as warrantable, undeniable,  and/or reliable. It expresses the writerâ€™s alignment with and endorsement of an attributed proposition. As such, the dialogic space is somewhat narrowed. |
| Expansion   | [Entertain](2_Part1_Understanding_Engagement.md#entertain)                                           | An utterance which indicates author's position but as only one possibility amongst others, thereby opening up dialogic space.                                                                                                        |
| Expansion   | [Attribute](2_Part1_Understanding_Engagement.md#attribute)                                           | An utterance which signifies dialogic space as the writer attributes the proposition to an external source.                                                                                                                          |
| Monogloss   | [Monogloss](2_Part1_Understanding_Engagement.md#monogloss)                                           | An utterance which does not employ any value of engagement. Such an utterance ignores the dialogic potential in an utterance.                                                                                                        |
| Auxiliary   | [Justify](2_Part1_Understanding_Engagement.md#justify)                                               | An utterance which engage in persuasion through justification or substantiation.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Auxiliary   | [Citations](2_Part1_Understanding_Engagement.md#citations-updated-on-feb-25th) (Updated on Feb 25th) | Citation is segment of the text where external source(s) are referenced in the text.                                                                                                                                                 |
