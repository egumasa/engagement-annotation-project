## Engagement coding scheme

There are 9 categories of engagement moves to annotate in the current project (see [Table 1](#table-1-categories-of-engagement-moves)). Most categories belong to "parent" (or more general) discourse moves, such as `contract` and `expand`. 

Figure 2 shows the entire taxonomy. Based on Figure 2, we can understand that we have finer-grained discource moves as we go deeper into the taxonomy (e.g., `heterogloss` > `contract` > `disclaim` > `deny`). I will explain what these categories mean shortly, but remember that this taxonomy presents alternative stance-taking strategies (or discourse choices) a writer can make to position themselves in the writings.

### Core Terminologies
The following sub-sections describe core terminologies (category labels) in the coding scheme.

#### Monogloss and Heterogloss
The first (the most coarse-grained) distinction concerns `monogloss` vs. `heterogloss`, which is about whether the utterance recognizes the alternative positions or not. In Monogloss, the utterance does not recognize any alternative views and presents the idea/event as a fact (e.g., "The banks have been greedy"). On the other hand, a heteroglossic utterance includes various ways to at least acknowledge possible alternatives (e.g., "I speculate that the banks have been greedy", "I read somewhere that the banks have been greedy.", "It is unlikely that the banks have been greedy.", etc.).

#### Expansion and Contraction
A heteroglossic move is divided into `expand` and `contract` moves. The distinction is about whether the writer opens up (`expand`) dialogic spaces for alternative viewpoints or to close down (`contract`) the spaces. 
Essentially, writers use `expand` moves to indicate that the idea is only one possible version of the reality. `Expansion` move is further divided into `entertain` and `attribute`, which are explained later.
On the other hand, writers use `contract` moves to close down the dialogic spaces. They can do this by (a) rejecting alternative viewpoints (`disclaim`) or (b) showing greater committment to their ideas (`proclaim`). 

#### Expansion moves—Entertain and Attribute
`Expansion` move includes discourse moves to (a) increase the tentativeness to the statement (`entertain`) and to (b) attribute the idea to external sources (`attribute`). 
For example, a writer can use lexico-grammatical items such as modal verbs (`can`, `may`) and mental verbs (`I believe`) to `entertain` other possible alternatives. The writers can refer to external sources (e.g., `the paper mentioned`) and remain neutral with respect to the presented idea. 

#### Contraction moves—Disclaim and Proclaim
`Contraction` moves concern different ways the writer advances their own views on the topic, and therefore, narrow down or close down the space for negotiation. 
Writers can `disclaim` other views by using `deny` option (e.g., "That is NOT correct.") or using `counter` option (e.g., "Although the paper may be right, there is another possibility."). 
The writers can `proclaim` their views by (a) assuming that the readers would agree their views (`concur`), (b) explicitly underscoring their views as valid (`pronounce`), or (c) use other's perspective/data/claims as correct and reliable (`endorse`).


<details><summary> Interrim Summary </summary>


- `Monoglossic utterance` = An utterance which involves a factual statement, without recognizing other potential views.


- `Heteroglossic utterance` = An utterance which recognizes that the referenced idea is one possible alternatives among others, regardless the author supports or rejects the idea.


- `Contraction strategy` = Discourse moves which close down dialogic space; the speaker/writer acts to challenge, fend off or restrict other alternative positions and voices.


- `Expansion strategy` = Discourse moves which open-up the dialogic space; the speaker/writer actively makes allowances for dialogically alternative positions and voices.

### Table 1. Categories of Engagement moves

| Strategy    | Engagement moves                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Contraction | [Disclaim: Deny](#disclaim-deny)                                  | An utterance which invokes a contrary position but which at the same time rejects it directly. The contrary position is hence given very little dialogic space.                                                                      |
| Contraction | [Disclaim: Counter](#disclaim-counter)                            | An utterance which expresses the present proposition as replacing and thus 'countering' another proposition which would have been expected.                                                                                          |
| Contraction | [Proclaim: Concur](#proclaim-concur)                              | An utterance which shows writers' expectation/assumption that the putative readers will agree with the preposition and/or to have the same knowledge.                                                                                |
| Contraction | [Proclaim: Pronounce](#proclaim-pronounce)                        | An utterance which expresses a strong level of writer commitment through the author's explicit emphasis and interpolation, thereby closing down the dialogic space.                                                                  |
| Contraction | [Proclaim: Endorse](#proclaim-endorse)                            | An utterance which refers to external sources as warrantable, undeniable,  and/or reliable. It expresses the writer’s alignment with and endorsement of an attributed proposition. As such, the dialogic space is somewhat narrowed. |
| Expansion   | [Entertain](#entertain)                                           | An utterance which indicates author's position but as only one possibility amongst others, thereby opening up dialogic space.                                                                                                        |
| Expansion   | [Attribute](#attribute)                                           | An utterance which signifies dialogic space as the writer attributes the proposition to an external source.                                                                                                                          |
| Monogloss   | [Monogloss](#monogloss)                                           | An utterance which does not employ any value of engagement. Such an utterance ignores the dialogic potential in an utterance.                                                                                                        |

| Auxiliary   | [Citations](#citations-updated-on-feb-25th) (Updated on Feb 25th) | Citation is segment of the text where external source(s) are referenced in the text.                                                                                                                                                 |

Note that in the example on this page, **Bold** face is used to show the span on which the tag is put. *Italics* shows the context which helps to decide the category.

We are going to look at the raw sentences and tag any of the following `engagement moves`. Using the previous example.
- `In my view (ENTERTAIN)`, the banks have been greedy.
- A book I read recently `said (ATTRIBUTE)` that the banks have been greedy.

Once again, these categories is about discourse meaning that writers make; therefore, the meaning can be realized through different levels of lexico-grammar. This is the topic of the next section.

## Engagement meaning can be expressed using different categories of lexical and grammatical resources

Meanings of engagement (stance-taking) are realized through a range of lexical and grammatical resources. Typical grammatical structures include:
- Modal auxiliaries (e.g., `can`, `may`, `must`)
- Stance adverbs (e.g., `obviously`, `naturally`, `probably`)
- Adverbial phrases (e.g., `according to X`,  `in my view`)
- Communication/mental verbs (e.g., `X said that`, `the study demonstrated`, `I think`)
- Attributive adjectives (e.g., `it is possible`, `it is likely`)
- Subordinate clauses (e.g., `even though`, `if X...`, `although ...`, `as far as I am concerned`)
- Negation (e.g., `not`, `never`)

The implications of this include:
- A particular engagement move can be expressed through different levels of grammar.
  - ==> Entertain can be expressed using modal verbs (`can`), adverbial/prepositional phrases (`in my view`), evidentials (`it seems that`).
- A same grammatical structure would function as distinct engagement meaning.
  - ==> Communication verbs (e.g., `suggest`) can express different meanings depending on its subject.  `the data suggest (ENTERTAIN)`  vs. `The author suggested (ATTRIBUTE)`.

So, It is important to fully understand what each category means through closely examines the examples presented below.

## More elaborated description of each category with examples
### Disclaim: Deny
> An utterance which invokes a contrary position but which at the same time rejects it directly. The contrary position is hence given very little dialogic space.

In other words, `deny` move includes acknowledgement to an alternative position so as to reject it. Typically the meaning is realized using negations.
- Linguistics is **not** easy.
- You do**n’t** need to give up potatoes to lose weight.
- these were definitely **not** the norm
- We are of course **not** dealing with one monolithic hegemonic English voice
- Natural gas burns with twice the heat of coal gas, is **not** poisonous and has **no** odor.
- There is **nothing** wrong with your proposal.

[Back to Table 1](#table-1-categories-of-engagement-moves)

### Disclaim: Counter
>An utterance which expresses the present proposition as replacing and thus 'countering' another proposition which would have been expected.

Typically, `disclaim: counter` involves conjunctions such as *although*, *but*, *however*, which signals the meanings of `Counter` in an explicit manner. This signals `concession` and `counter expectations`.
- **Although the religion motif was not commonly discussed among the discussants**, the relevance of this theme to these various texts need to be brought to attention.
- **Although provisional**, our model has implications for pedagogy.
- **Despite the fact that both parties were manorial peasants** , they must have found it very difficult to understand each other 's lifestyles .
- In comparison, 32% of the respondents felt that the conventional downtown was still a major attraction, **even though the regional centre had gained quite a vast amount of popularity and did to large extent have an air of modernity**.
- **While the Supreme Court rejected the “quality of care” argument in the federation case**, the oligopolistic characteristics and purchasing structure of insurance make this outcome unsurprising.
- **While that grief is deeply understood**, the problem with tragedies like this one is that they become a heyday for the overly-sincere, maudlin, righteousindignation crowd.
- **Even though he had taken all his medication**, his leg did n’t look any better.
- Every single law is addressed to the men, with the use of the pronoun “he” throughout the text, **even** when the laws are closely referring to female issues.
- The author **should have** considered all the potnetial interpretations before making a strong claim. 

`Disclaim: Counter` sometimes includes less obvious realizations. For example, adjuncts such as *even*, *only*, *just*, and *still* may "also have a counter-expectational aspect to their meanings" (Martin & White, p. 121).
- They **even** organised a car for you at the airport.
- **Still**, they were able to win the game.

`Disclaim: Counter` would also include some adverbs that encode meanings of counter-expectations.
- **Unexpectedly/Surprisingly/To my surprise**, there seems to have been little smuggling this year.

[Back to Table 1](#table-1-categories-of-engagement-moves)

### Proclaim: Concur
>An utterance which shows writers' expectation for the putative readers to agree with the preposition and/or to have the same knowledge.
This includes lexico-grammatical items such as `naturally`, `if course`, `obviously`, `admittedly`. These items reveal writer's expectation for the reader to agree with the idea.

There are two sub-types of `concur` which we do not differentiate in the current project. These are `affirm` and `concede` (Tan, 2010).  

`Affirm` examples
- The ability of a population to successfully reproduce is **obviously** a crucial aspect of a society’s survival.
- Bailey, **of course**, was that rarity, a cricketer who at his best was worldclass with both bat and ball.
- The Bush administration, **as we all know**, has rejected the Kyoto agreement
- **As we can see**, the popularity of Woodlands new town between residents and non-residents is directly opposite to each other.
- Furthermore , **we can easily see** that the semantic overdetermination of the Pygmalion story is already there , as J. Hillis Miller sees , in Ovid .
- _Everyone **knows** that_ linguistics is fun.

`Concede` examples
- **Admittedly**, he was badly behaved.
- **Indeed**, it is odd that both the FTC and courts have historically regarded huge, publicly traded insurance firms rather than health providers as the legal proxy of patients.
- **Sure**, he broke rules.
- If, **as all the pundits are saying**, there is no hope of normalcy returning soon

Some tricky example, but we all categorize them under `concur`:
- **Certainly** he was badly behaved but look at what he has achieved.

NOTE: **Certainly** illustrates there may be multiple functions that an item can accomplish depending on the context. Here, "Certainly ...., but" can be considered as `concur`, but certainly can be used as `Entertain` (see example).

Rhetorical questions are sometimes categorized as `Concur`:
- **Should we go to war against these children? (CONCUR)** (Tip: Tag the entire question.)

See [Rhetorical questions](/docs/4_Part3_confusing_tags.md#rhetorical-questions) for other possibilities.

### Proclaim: Pronounce
>An utterance which expresses a strong level of writer commitment through the author's explicit emphasis and interpolation.

In pronounce, the writer shows strong commitment that their idea is TRUE. Reader would consider that this is a very bold move.
Pronounce is where you 
- _I **contend**_ it's the worst address by a British Prime Minister.
- _I would **contend** that_ this enviable level of tolerance is not the result of direct government laws or interventions.
- _I would **affirm**_ the judgment of the trail court and deny the motion to suppress Oliver’s statement.
- **It is absolutely clear to me that** what Charlotte was arguing was that Crouching Tiger was a bad film to which liberal audiences imputed a significance shaped by their own prejudices about Chinese cinema and the Chinese in general.
- **It is evident that** a powerful political - industrial complex with a developmentalist ideology remains the greatest threat to the environment of Taiwan .
- _I therefore **propose** that_ universities have a greater role in working alongside the NCAA in negotiating its television.
- One of the arrested people **in fact** was a Hindu, a chef from Hong Kong.
- _We have to **remember** that_ bobbies move around - and slowly.
- _The absolute **fact** is that_ linguistics is fun.
- _But the **facts** of the matter are that_ we have never made the national decisions or marshaled the national resources required for such leadership.
- The scare was enough to close the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong for a day, though the men **turned out** to be tourists
- **There is no doubt that** globalization has a deep effect on China.
  
- I _**DID**_ turn out the lights before I left.

Pronounce is also realized by **intensifiers with clausal scope** such as `really`, `indeed`, etc.
- I **really** think that it is true.
- **Indeed**, a binary definition of the environment increases the strength of spatial relations and the measure of spatial autocorrelation. 
- The language spoken at that period is **undoubtedly** called Middle English, which is sandwiched in‑between by Old English and Modern English. (Note: undoutedly expresses authors committment to their assersion.)
- In this way the company can **definitely** fulfil the fluctuating demand. (Note: definitely carries the author's subjective involvement to the company's capacity.)

**What's NOT pronounce?**

Although the author may show "assessment of high probability" (e.g., He **must** be lying.; I'm **convinced** that he is lying), these are still expansive.
So, these are still classified as ENTERTAIN. In other words, even if the percieved probability is high, they still present it as one of the potential alternative views (ENTERTAIN).
Martin and White (2005) writes:

>Accordingly, as assessments of probability, such modals are dialogically expansive – they still ‘entertain’ the possibility of dialogistical alternatives. Pronouncements, in contrast, do not ‘entertain’ alternative positions in this way but, as we have demonstrated, are directed towards challenging and dismissing an alternative viewpoint.

### Proclaim: Endorse
>An utterance which refers to external sources as warrantable, undeniable, and/or reliable. It expresses the writer’s alignment with and endorsement of an attributed proposition. As such, the dialogic space is somewhat narrowed.

Essentially, in `Endorse` option, a writer use an external source and align with it to support their views. 
Typically, this is achieved by the use of verbal processes and their nominalized equivalents. Compared to `Attribute`, `Endorse` encodes writers more approval of the content.
- _Evidence **showed** that_ . . . there was “a large number of small competitors, the absence of significant price wars, . . .”
- _An interview by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) concerning national identity **revealed** that_ 50% of those interviewed feel that they think of themselves more as citizens of the world than any particular country, up from 45% in 1993.
- More specifically, _five studies **demonstrate** that_ investment dependence – investment by foreign firms in a society’s domestic economy increases economic inequality.
- For instance, _young learners were **found** to_ perform differently on both text comprehension (e.g., Langer, 1985) and production (e.g. Hidi & Hidyard, 1983).
- **As discussants correctly pointed out**, Bernardino of Siena, Martin Le Franc, and the anonymous author of the Errores Gazariorum all have an even more aggressive campaign against witches than did the authors of our previous readings.

Furthermore, `Endorse` may involve a pattern `ADV + VERB` where adverbs adds extra meaning to `Endorse` the external sources:
- ... **convincingly argued** ...
- ... **compellingly propounded** ...
- ... **successfully explained** ...
- As Hastie (an Englishman of their own political persuasion) so **compellingly argued**, ‘In any society racism will increase in direct proportion to the number of people who are given well-paid and prestigious positions to discover it.’

[Back to Table 1](#table-1-categories-of-engagement-moves)

### Entertain
>An utterance which opens the dialogic space by acknowledging a proposition as one possibility amongst others.

Entertain can be achieved by a range of lexico-grammatical resources. These include but not limited to, modal verbs (`may`), conditional clauses (`if`), evidential markers (`appear/seem`), and adverbial phrases (`generally`, `perhaps`).  

ENTERTAIN move signals author's own subjectivity to present the idea. 
- **In my view/from my perspective/in my opinion**, linguistics is fun.
- _I **think/suppose/suspect**_ Mary teaches French
- _I **believe**_ that he’s lying. 
- _It **appears** that_ maximum price fixing does the greatest harm when set below a competitive level.
- _That mismatch **seems**_ worse than it was ten years ago.
- _His defensive behaviour **suggests**_ he feels ashamed and guilty that you’ve discovered his habit.
- _He **may**_ be lying.
- It **may** have been the most immature, irresponsible, disgraceful and misleading address ever given by a British Prime Minister.
- You **must** switch off the lights when you leave.
- _**Probably/apparently/perhaps**_ he’s lying.
- It was **probably/arguably** the most immature, irresponsible, disgraceful and misleading address ever given by a British Prime Minister.
- _It’s **probable/likely/possible** that_ he's lying.
- Of course, _there’s **precious little chance**_ of that happening in America any time soon.
- He has **certainly** disgraced the Attorney General’s office in lending credence to the assertions of the Swift Boat veterans for Truth.

ENTERTAIN can include phrasing where the authors set the condition under which their claims apply.
- _**Generally speaking**_, if a person repented the church would pardon him or her regardless of how atrocious the crime was.
- **If we accept that differences are not only good and sameness is dull and non - competitive** , then it is easy to see that diversity , in fact , can be a competitive advantage .
- But, I **think** it **will** last **as long as Bill sticks to his current strategy**.


Rhetorical questions are sometimes categorized as `Entertain` include following examples:
- **So what brings happiness to our life? (ENTERTAIN)** (Tip: Tag the entire question.) 

See [Rhetorical questions](/docs/4_Part3_confusing_tags.md#rhetorical-questions)

[Back to Table 1](#table-1-categories-of-engagement-moves)

### Attribute
>An utterance which signifies dialogic space as the writer attributes the proposition to an external source.

Typically, this move is achieved by "X [third person] says/reports/states/declares/announces" or "According to X", which shows that the idea is borrowed from the external source.
Martin & White (2005) says: "Under the heading of ‘attribution’, we deal with those formulations which disassociate the proposition from the text’s internal authorial voice by attributing it so some external source."

In many cases, `ATTRIBUTE` occurs where the author explicitly mention the source of information and ackowledge that the original idea is theirs.
- _Mr. Mandela **said**_ the Group of Eight nations have a duty to help battle the scourge of AIDS.
- _Dawkins **believes** that_ religion is not an adaptive evolutionary vestige, but in fact a cultural virus.
- _Most linguists **believe** that_ linguistic structure is most productively studied in its own terms, with its communicative use(s) considered separately.
- _Hovenkamp **argues** that_ a company could have one hundred percent market share both as a newspaper publisher and distributor, and still have no monopoly power.
- _**According to the authors**_, he gave new witches everything they wished as long as they sold their soul to him.
- **As the discussant post “Witchcraft and Sexual Deviance” mentioned**, the church and the public believed that if witches were willing to so publicly flout the word of the Lord, they must also disobey other societal conventions.
- _Tickner has **claimed** that_ regardless of the result, the royal commission was a waste of money and he would proceed with a separate inquiry into the issue headed by Justice Jane Matthews.
- _**In Wong’s study**_, another ‘‘geographical imagination’’ of Lucky Plaza is the view that it is a place where the Filipino maids get to know their ‘boyfriends’.
- **Chomsky’s belief** that language is for individuals rather than groups .

In some cases, the author can present the idea without specifying the sources (but still present it as something they hear about).
- _It is **said** that_ he lied about his age as he grew older …
- The government’s serologist **reportedly** lied about his qualifications.
- _It is generally **understood** that_ science has developed a highly sophisticated way of representing ideas.


Compared to `Endorse`, `Attribute` keeps a neutral stance on the content attributed.

[Back to Table 1](#table-1-categories-of-engagement-moves)

### Justify

>An utterance which engage in persuasion through justification or substantiation.
This move is typically achieved by subordinate clauses or prepositional phrases expressing reasons (e.g., `because`, `considering that`, `given that`, `because of`, `due to`).

- **Because the steps are made of a smooth, polished—and therefore slippery—stone**, the BTA should’ve taken precautions to clean the steps in such wintry conditions.
- Accessibility is quite a key factor **because it is evident that the regional centre was built on the basis of good infrastructure**.
- **Because of the event happening next year**, the housing prices have gone up so rapidly around here.
- **Given that about a quarter of all employed people move on and off the payrolls of individual firms during the year** , a need to move between firms to climb the career ladder would not seem to be a difficult barrier to surmount .
- The items had been produced by ANPWS **for the following reasons** : ( a ) to generate publicity ( for some of Australia 's national parks ) , ( b ) to meet existing information requests from school students and the general public ( such as on Australia 's endangered plants ) , ( c ) to generate interest in particular topics ( such as remnant vegetation ) , and ( d ) to explain government policy ( on kangaroo harvesting ) . 


[Back to Table 1](#table-1-categories-of-engagement-moves)

### Monogloss
>An utterance which does not employ any value of engagement. Such an utterance ignores the dialogic potential in an utterance.
**As of April 9th, we will NOT use a Monogloss tag. A main clause without any engagement values are all considered monogloss.**
Examine this fact in the following examples, where there should be no engagement-invoking lexico-grammatical items in each sentence.

- Teachers are facing the difficult task of providing an optimal learning environment to students from varying social, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds.
- What is interesting in this example is how neither of the two views that are attributed to others is actually endorsed by the author, even though they are entertained and explicated.
- The purpose of maintaining an expansive approach here is clear: the author seeks to present perspectives and research conducted thus far to lay the groundwork for what should be done.
- Television has helped to shrink the relative distance between people and countries.
- When the news came through that the National Air Traffic Services (Nats) was in financial trouble and was being offered a £60 million rescue package, the reaction of the first union official to pop up on the BBC’s radar screen was predictable.
- The preposterous idea that privatisation puts profit before safety was a commonplace long before Nats was born.
- In the past few years there have been a number of moral panics about racism, accompanied by self-serving calls from predictable quarters for more government action to deal with the problem.

An imperative clause is also classified as monogloss (Martin & White, 2005, p.111):
- Turn out (MONOGLOSSS) the lights before you leave.

Note that modal verbs to express obligations (should, must) are categorized as `Entertain`:
- You **must (ENTERTAIN)** turn out the lights before you leave

These example are said to include no recognition of alternative viewpoints. That is, the writers treat the idea as an *established fact* at least in the sentence (i.e., bare assertion). It is also possible to say that these `monoglossic` sentences do **NOT** have any engagement items. 
To test if the sentence is monogloss, you can try adding any engagement items, for example:
- _The author **argued** that (ATTRIBUTE)_ television has helped to shrink the relative distance between people and countries.
- _Television can be **said (ATTRIBUTE)**_ to have helped to shrink the relative distance between people and countries.
- **In some regions (ENTERTAIN)**, television has helped to shrink the relative distance between people and countries.

### Citations (Updated on Feb 25th.)

> Citation is segment of the text where external source(s) are referenced in the text. 

There are several types of citation format to identify in the current corpus. 
In the dataset to annotate, there will be cases where the citation is cut in the middle (e.g., `(Bell &amp;amp.`). 
This is because the automatic system I used to segment the essay into sentences is not perfect. 
In such cases, we will still tag the fragment of the citation as `CITATION`. (see more example of this kind)

#### 1. Narrative citation—Author (DATE) pattern
Narrative citation pattern is where author's name is explicitly referenced in the prose. 

The following examples were taken from Nesi (2021):
- **Schapiro et al. (2001)** demonstrated (BAWE code: 3060a SS level 4)
- **Lipton (1991, p.419)** refers (BAWE code: 0177b AH level 3)
- In 1991, **Aram et al. (Menyuk, 1995:4)** reviewed (BAWE code: 6206b AH level 3)
- **Batliwala (1993 cited in Sen, 1997: 2)** brings into focus (BAWE code: 0422a SS level 4)
- **Piaget (as cited in Rubin, LeMare and Lollis, 1990)** offers (BAWE code: 0014c LS level 2)
- **Gisela Bock (in Bridenthal et al., 1984)** argues (BAWE code: 0408f SS level 3)
- quoted by **Aitchison (1989:260)** as claiming (BAWE code: 6055a AH level 1)
- supported by **Kjelsan et al. (2004)** who found (BAWE code: 0014a LS level 2)
- In **Brown et al. (1994)** it says to look for (BAWE code: 3101b SS level 1)
- In another study by **Kerr and MacCoun (1985)** theydemonstrated (BAWE code: 0014e LS level 3)
- **Lloyd and Lishman (1975)** originally demonstrated (BAWE code: 0016a LS level 1)
- Some predictions made by **Robertson et al (1999)** make this even clearer’
- - According to **Jones (1998)**, "students often had difficulty using APA style, especially when it was their first time" **(p. 199)**.

Note: BAWE code shows the writing ID number in the British Academic Written English corpus (Nesi & Gardner, 2012).

#### 2. In-text citations—(Author, date) pattern
In-text citations are those which the external sources are cited in parenthetical form.

Nesi (2021) presented the following examples:
- ideas of nationalism often associated with both the ideology and actions of racism **(Fenton, 1999)** (BAWE code: 0001a SS level 1)
- the coping technique adopted to achieve what is believed to be desirable **(Gordon, 1990)** (BAWE code: 0014a LS level 2)
- his theory on blackbody radiation **(Planck 1900)** for which he was later awarded a Nobel Prize (BAWE code: 0109a PS level 1)
- phosphorus loss can occur through soil erosion **(DEFRA, 2003)**.
- one-third to half of all diabetics already have evidence of organ or tissue damage **(UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group, 1991)**. (6012g LS level 2)

Additionally, you will encounter a various citation format during the annotation.
**MLA (and ASA as closely associated format)**
- Romantic poetry is characterized by the "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" **(Wordsworth 263)**.
- Wordsworth extensively explored the role of emotion in the creative process **(263)**.
- Human beings have been described as "symbol-using animals" **(Burke 3)**.
- Marx and Engels described human history as marked by class struggles **(79; ch. 1)**.
- Relativity's theoretical foundations can be traced to earlier work by Faraday and Maxwell **(Einstein 782)**.
- Although some medical ethicists claim that cloning will lead to designer children **(R. Miller 12)**, others note that the advantages for medical research outweigh this consideration **(A. Miller 46)**.
- The authors claim that one cause of obesity in the United States is government-funded farm subsidies **(Franck et al. 327)**.

**IEEE (Note that many of this has already been converted to [#REF] in the data)**
- A trenchcoat and mask can easily disguise a few owls as a human, as experimentally shown by **Smith [1], [2]**.
- Italian owls are suspicious of outsiders, as noted in **[3]–[5]**.
- This is disputed by **Civetta [6]** and **Strix [7]**, who are not owls in masks.
- The city of Florence is under an ancient curse, as repeatedly and exhaustively described in **[8]**, **[10]**, **[13]–[17]**, **[20]**.

#### 3.The use of ibid., etc.
`ibid` is sometimes used to indicate the already-referenced materials. 
- His conclusion is that the vegetation was predominantly closed forest, but that some areas such as floodplains and chalklands had more open vegetation **(ibid: 140)**.

When the sentence included references as follows, typically used with `(op.cit.)`, mark the entire sequence as citation:
- **Millington, T., & Sutherland Williams, M., (op.cit.), pp.2**
