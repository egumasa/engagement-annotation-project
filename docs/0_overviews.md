## Annotation task description
{: .no_toc }

This page provides an overview on the procedure of Engagement resource annotation. 
Essentially, we will provide annotations for the following layers in that order:

**Step 1**: Clause boundary detection

**Step 2**: Engagement span detection

**Step 3**: Engagement stateragy annotation

**Step 4**: Primary vs Secondary engagement classification

**Step 5**: Supplementary rhetorical device annotation

These steps are explained below.

## Step 0 Sentence boundary detection

Each annotation data comes with automatically detected sentence boundaries (each line represents a new sentence). Sometimes, the automated detection of sentence boundaries fails for reasons. In such case, we will indicate a correct sentence boundary. This step is necessary only for a file with sentence boundary problems.



## Step 1 Clause boundary detection

The annotation should start with clause boundary segmengation and clause type identification. In this task, you will segment a running text into sentences/clauses and categorize the type of clauses (e.g., `MAIN`, `SUBORDINATE`).
The purpose of this layer is help you better identify engagement strategies (Step 2 and 3) as well as detection of primary vs secondary engagement (Step 4).

The following figure shows the result of this step.

Essentially, you would follow the steps described in [clause boundary detection](1_Clause/index.md).
You can also see real examples of this step in the clause [here](1_Clause/cl_strategies.md).


## Step 2 Engagement span detection

Once the clause layer has been tagged, the next step is to identify any engagement strategies in the sentences. Step 2 and 3 are dedicated to this process. 
Although Step 2 and 3 are presented separately, you would start identifying engagement categories (Step 3) immediately without explicitly following the recommended steps (Step 2 -> 3). This is totally fine. Just make sure that you identify the span of the engagement strategy correctly, which is described in this step. Alternatively, you can repeat Step 2 and 3 for each items you identified in the running sentence(s).

For more details of this step see [tag spans](2_Step2_tag_spans.md).


## Step 3 Engagement strategy annotation

For each of the engagement resource spans, decide specific category from the list of engagement strategies (e.g., `ENTERTAIN`, `ATTRIBUTE`, `CONCUR`, etc.).

For details, see [engagement category](3_Categories/index.md).

Once you are done with this step, the annotation should look like the following:

![engagement-category](../figures/procedures/engagement_category.png)


## Step 4 Primary vs Secondary strategy classification

As the final step, we will classify engagement resource into primary and secondary strategies.
Primary strategies are those that determines the engagement values of the whole [T-unit](../docs/1_Basic_grammar.md#terminal-unit-t-unit).
Secondary strategies are those that supplement the primary engagement values in the clause; this often occurs (but not always) in the subordinate/embedded clauses.


For details, see [primary vs secondary strategy](Step4_primary_secondary.md).

## Resource layers

### Part of Speech layer

You can refer to Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags automatically generated by spaCy during the annotation. 
There are two layers in the POS annotation. One is coarse-grained (UPOS); the other is finer-grained (XPOS).
For UPOS, see the following documentation from [Universal Dependency project](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/).
For XPOS, see the following table from spaCy documentation on [POS scheme](https://v2.spacy.io/api/annotation#pos-tagging).
