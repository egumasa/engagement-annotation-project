### Attribute

EXPANSION
{: .label .label-blue }

{: .def}
>An utterance which signifies dialogic space as the writer attributes the proposition to an external source.

Attribute is another expansion strategy. In this move, the writer presents an idea as a version of the truth by (explicitly or implicitly) referring to an external source (e.g., other authors/studies). The attribution can be made to some unspecified sources (see [below](#hear-say-as-attribute)). The writer essentially have no stake in reporting the idea. This can be contrasted with [`ENDORSE`](#proclaim-endorse), where the author shows greater alignments to the attributed idea as a valid and reliable one (hence contraction).

Typically, this move is achieved by "X [third person] says/reports/states/declares/announces" or "According to X", which shows that the idea is borrowed from the external source.
Martin & White (2005) says: "Under the heading of ‘attribution’, we deal with those formulations which disassociate the proposition from the text’s internal authorial voice by attributing it so some external source."

In many cases, `ATTRIBUTE` occurs where the author explicitly mention the source of information and ackowledge that the original idea is theirs.
- _Mr. Mandela **said**_ the Group of Eight nations have a duty to help battle the scourge of AIDS.
- _Dawkins **believes** that_ religion is not an adaptive evolutionary vestige, but in fact a cultural virus.
- _Most linguists **believe** that_ linguistic structure is most productively studied in its own terms, with its communicative use(s) considered separately.
- _Hovenkamp **argues** that_ a company could have one hundred percent market share both as a newspaper publisher and distributor, and still have no monopoly power.
- _**According to the authors**_, he gave new witches everything they wished as long as they sold their soul to him.
- **As the discussant post “Witchcraft and Sexual Deviance” mentioned**, the church and the public believed that if witches were willing to so publicly flout the word of the Lord, they must also disobey other societal conventions.
- _Tickner has **claimed** that_ regardless of the result, the royal commission was a waste of money and he would proceed with a separate inquiry into the issue headed by Justice Jane Matthews.
- _**In Wong’s study**_, another ‘‘geographical imagination’’ of Lucky Plaza is the view that it is a place where the Filipino maids get to know their ‘boyfriends’.
- **Chomsky’s belief** that language is for individuals rather than groups .
- In response to Jackson 's **assertion** that African Americans had progressed a lot in eighty odd years, Young **interrupted** him again and **informed** him, "we are not going to wait eighty more years, I will tell you that."

##### Hear-say as ATTRIBUTE
In some cases, the author can present the idea without specifying the sources (but still present it as something they hear about).
- _It is **said** that_ he lied about his age as he grew older …
- The government’s serologist **reportedly** lied about his qualifications.
- _It is generally **understood** that_ science has developed a highly sophisticated way of representing ideas.

##### Implicit attribution

{: .label .label-green}

Additionally, `ATTRIBUTE` would include some implicit attribution like the followings:
- Van de Kooi and Knorr (1973) **measured** one office building and five small dwellings over a period from February 1967 to August 1967 in The Netherlands.

&rarr; This can be interpreted as "Van de Kooi and Knorr (1973) **(reported that they)** measured ~." So, in the annotation, we will tag **measured** as `ATTRIBUTE` (see Hood, 2010, p. 181).

- Anderson (2004) **offers** a number of suggestions.

&rarr; Here, **offer + suggestion** can be interpreted as `abstract representation` (called `grammatical metaphor`) of Anderson suggested many things. So, in the annotation we will put `ATTRIBUTE` tag on **offers**.


Compared to [`Endorse`](#proclaim-endorse), `Attribute` keeps a neutral stance on the content attributed.

##### Attribution using prepositional phrase

Some prepositional phrases signaling (metaphorical) locations, can be treated as `ATTRIBUTE`, when that location is an external source.
This include following examples:

- _**In Wong’s study**_, another ‘‘geographical imagination’’ of Lucky Plaza is the view that it is a place where the Filipino maids get to know their ‘boyfriends’.
-  **In recent research on human evolution**, unique abilities for exact imitation contributed signally to our unique evolutionary trajectory.
