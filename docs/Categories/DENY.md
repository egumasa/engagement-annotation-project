### Disclaim: Deny

CONTRACTION
{: .label .label-yellow }

{: .def}
>An utterance which invokes a contrary position but which at the same time rejects it directly. The contrary position is hence given very little dialogic space.

In other words, `deny` move includes acknowledgement to an alternative position so as to reject it. Typically the meaning is realized using negations.
- Linguistics is **not** easy.
- You do**n’t** need to give up potatoes to lose weight.
- these were definitely **not** the norm
- We are of course **not** dealing with one monolithic hegemonic English voice
- Natural gas burns with twice the heat of coal gas, is **not** poisonous and has **no** odor.
- There is **nothing** wrong with your proposal.


#### Tagging `not only` as [COUNTER](2_Part1_Understanding_Engagement.md#disclaim-counter)


{: .tips}
  We will treat following expressions as `COUNTER` not `DENY`:
  - `not only`
  - `not just`
  The reason for this decision is that we found that `not only` does not always paired with `but also` but still works just like a `COUNTER` move. This indicates that `not only` is a multiword expression that has potential to `COUNTER` the discourse by itself.

#### Tagging negative prefixes such as `un-`, `non-`

When you encounter negative prefixes, consider whether that negative prefix negates the predicates (propositions).
Some example of you could tag them as `DENY` include:

- As a result , **it is unable to** come up with enough gas to meet internal demand and its export obligations.
- **It is impossible to** see the ultimate goals of either side being realized .

But the same word may not take `DENY` move because they do NOT disclaim a view point.
- The net result appears to be that these incomplete theories often portray minority children and their families as educationally inferior and _unable_ to benefit from traditional mental health practices .

In this example, `unable` is used to describe a percieved property of minority families by what the writer terms as incomplete theory. It does NOT DENY the proposition itself.

- The reporting for JE laboratory testing was vague and _incomplete_ .
This is also another example of non-DENY negative prefix.

- But it would have been an _impossible_ task without the assistance and advice of the Exhibition Webmaster.

Here, the word "impossible" describes a property of a task. The writer then ENTERTAINs this property by "would have been", making the overall engagement move as `ENTERTAIN`, not `DENY`.
