### Citations (Updated on Feb 25th.)

{: .def}
> Citation is segment of the text where external source(s) are referenced in the text. 

There are several types of citation format to identify in the current corpus. 
In the dataset to annotate, there will be cases where the citation is cut in the middle (e.g., `(Bell &amp;amp.`). 
This is because the automatic system I used to segment the essay into sentences is not perfect. 
In such cases, we will still tag the fragment of the citation as `CITATION`. (see more example of this kind)

When `CITATION` is the only move in the sentence, use `MONOGLOSS` tag.
