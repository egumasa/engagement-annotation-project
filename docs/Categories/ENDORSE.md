CONTRACTION
{: .label .label-yellow }

{: .def}
>An utterance which refers to external sources as warrantable, undeniable, and/or reliable. It expresses the writer’s alignment with and endorsement of an attributed proposition. As such, the dialogic space is somewhat narrowed.

Essentially, in `Endorse` option, a writer use an external source and align with it to support their views. 
Typically, this is achieved by the use of verbal processes and their nominalized equivalents. Compared to [`Attribute`](#attribute), `Endorse` encodes writers more approval of the content.

- _Evidence **showed** that_ . . . there was “a large number of small competitors, the absence of significant price wars, . . .”
- _An interview by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) concerning national identity **revealed** that_ 50% of those interviewed feel that they think of themselves more as citizens of the world than any particular country, up from 45% in 1993.
- First, _the study **found** that_ advisee perceptions of their advisor 's credibility was positively related to advisee perceptions of advisor mentoring and an advisor 's use of solution-oriented conflict management strategies. 
- More specifically, _five studies **demonstrate** that_ investment dependence – investment by foreign firms in a society’s domestic economy increases economic inequality.
- For instance, _young learners were **found** to_ perform differently on both text comprehension (e.g., Langer, 1985) and production (e.g. Hidi & Hidyard, 1983).
- **As discussants correctly pointed out**, Bernardino of Siena, Martin Le Franc, and the anonymous author of the Errores Gazariorum all have an even more aggressive campaign against witches than did the authors of our previous readings.

Furthermore, `Endorse` may involve a pattern `ADV + VERB` where adverbs adds extra meaning to `Endorse` the external sources:
- ... **convincingly argued** ...
- ... **compellingly propounded** ...
- ... **successfully explained** ...
- As Hastie (an Englishman of their own political persuasion) so **compellingly argued**, ‘In any society racism will increase in direct proportion to the number of people who are given well-paid and prestigious positions to discover it.’
