## What is this document?
- This document explains the framework for manual annotation of the corpus. 
- We use the `engagement framework` (Martin & While, 2005) in order to annotate lexico-grammatical features of stance-taking.
- What is stance-taking (/expressions)?—It is elements in the discourse that express the writer's levels of commitment to the idea presented in the writing. For example, a writer can add tentativeness to their idea by acknowledging that it is only one of the possible interpretations. Compare different versions of the same argument:
	- 1. The banks have been greedy. (Stated as if it is a fact)
	- 2. In my view, the banks have been greedy. (Presented as a personal view)
	- 3. A book I read recently said that the banks have been greedy. (Acknowledging a source)
- The ability to appropriately adjust the level of commitment to the idea is one of the important aspects of academic writing. 
- In this project, we will annotate sentences taken from academic essays in terms of the lexico-grammatical features of stance-taking.

## The Goals of the project
- To create a human-annotated corpus of academic English on stance-taking expressions.
- More specifically:
	- To identify specific lexico-grammatical items that enact meanings of stance-taking (e.g., `in my view`, `X said`)
	- To identify specific meanings of stance-taking (we call this Engagement moves) for the identified lexico-grammar items.

## Engagement coding scheme
There are 9 categories in the Engagement framework. They are essentially semantic or discourse "choices" that writers make in their writing. We are going to look at the raw sentences and tag any of the following `engagement moves`. Using the previous example.
- `In my view (ENTERTAIN)`, the banks have been greedy.
- A book I read recently `said (ATTRIBUTE)` that the banks have been greedy.

| Strategy      | Engagement moves    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Contraction   | Disclaim: Deny      | An utterance which invokes a contrary position but which at the same time rejects it directly. The contrary position is hence given very little dialogic space.                                                                      |
| Contraction   | Disclaim: Counter   | An utterance which expresses the present proposition as replacing and thus 'countering' another proposition which would have been expected.                                                                                          |
| Contraction   | Proclaim: Concur    | An utterance which shows writers' expectation for the putative readers to agree with the preposition and/or to have the same knowledge.                                                                                              |
| Contraction   | Proclaim: Pronounce | An utterance which expresses a strong level of writer commitment through the author's explicit emphasis and interpolation.                                                                                                           |
| Contraction   | Proclaim: Endorse   | An utterance which refers to external sources as warrantable, undeniable,  and/or reliable. It expresses the writer’s alignment with and endorsement of an attributed proposition. As such, the dialogic space is somewhat narrowed. |
| Expansion     | Entertain           | An utterance which opens the dialogic space by acknowledging a proposition as one possibility amongst others.                                                                                                                        |
| Expansion     | Attribute           | An utterance which signifies dialogic space as the writer attributes the proposition to an external source.                                                                                                                           |
| Justification | Justify             | An utterance which engage in persuasion through justification or substantiation.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Monogloss     | Monogloss           | An utterance which does not employ any value of engagement. Such an utterance ignores the dialogic potential in an utterance.                                                                                                        |

Once again, these categories is about discourse meaning that writers make; therefore, the meaning can be realized through different levels of lexico-grammar. This is the topic of the next section.

## Engagement meaning can be expressed using different categories of lexical and grammatical resources
- Meanings of engagement (stance-taking) are realized through a range of lexical and grammatical resources. This means that engagement can be expressed through:
	- Adverbial phrases (e.g., `according to X`, `as far as I am concerned`, `in my view`)
	- Stance adverbs (e.g., `obviously`, `naturally`, `probably`)
	- Modal auxiliaries (e.g., `can`, `may`, `must`)
	- Communication/mental verbs (e.g., `X said that`, `the study demonstrated`, `I think`)
	- Attributive adjectives (e.g., `it is possible`)
	- Subordinate clauses (e.g., `even though`, `if X...`, `although ...`)
	- Negation (e.g., `not`, `never`)
- The implications of this include:
	- A particular engagement move can be expressed through different levels of grammar.
		- ==> Entertain can be expressed using modal verbs (`can`), adverbial/prepositional phrases (`in my view`), evidentials (`it seems that`).
	- A same grammatical structure would function as distinct engagement meaning.
		- ==> Communication verbs (e.g., `suggest`) can express different meanings depending on its subject.  `the data suggest (ENTERTAIN)`  vs. `The author suggested (ATTRIBUTE)`.
- So, It is important to fully understand what each category means through closely examines the examples presented below.

## Examples
### Disclaim: Deny
>An utterance which invokes a contrary position but which at the same time rejects it directly. The contrary position is hence given very little dialogic space.
- You do**n’t** need to give up potatoes to lose weight.
- these were definitely **not** the norm

### Disclaim: Counter
>An utterance which expresses the present proposition as replacing and thus 'countering' another proposition which would have been expected.

- **While the Supreme Court rejected the “quality of care” argument in the federation case**, the oligopolistic characteristics and purchasing structure of insurance make this outcome unsurprising.

### Proclaim: Concur
>An utterance which shows writers' expectation for the putative readers to agree with the preposition and/or to have the same knowledge.
- The ability of a population to successfully reproduce is **obviously** a crucial aspect of a society’s survival.

- I therefore **propose** that universities have a greater role in working alongside the NCAA in negotiating its television.
- I **DID** turn out the lights before I left.

### Proclaim: Endorse
>An utterance which refers to external sources as warrantable, undeniable, and/or reliable. It expresses the writer’s alignment with and endorsement of an attributed proposition. As such, the dialogic space is somewhat narrowed.

- **As discussants correctly pointed out**, Bernardino of Siena, Martin Le Franc, and the anonymous author of the Errores Gazariorum all have an even more aggressive campaign against witches than did the authors of our previous readings.

### Entertain
>An utterance which opens the dialogic space by acknowledging a proposition as one possibility amongst others.

### Attribute
>An utterance which signifies dialogic space as the writer attributes the proposition to an external source.
- **Mr. Mandela said** the Group of Eight nations have a duty to help battle the scourge of AIDS.

### Monogloss
>An utterance which does not employ any value of engagement. Such an utterance ignores the dialogic potential in an utterance.

This is when no engagement resource can be found in the T-unit.
- Teachers are facing the difficult task of providing an optimal learning environment to students from varying social, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds.
- What is interesting in this example is how neither of the two views that are attributed to others is actually endorsed by the author, even though they are entertained and explicated.
- The purpose of maintaining an expansive approach here is clear: the author seeks to present perspectives and research conducted thus far to lay the groundwork for what should be done.
- Television has helped to shrink the relative distance between people and countries.



## Multiple engagement resources in a T-unit
Often times, we will find multiple engagement resources in a single unit (T-unit). 
- **As the name implies (ATTRIBUTE)** **it seemed (ENTERTAIN)** as if eating children was one of the main focuses of anti-witch writings.
- **Even (COUNTER)** **if repenting (ENTERTAIN)**, the person **could (ENTERTAIN)** still be deceived by the devil again, and **would (ENTERTAIN)** return as a threat.
