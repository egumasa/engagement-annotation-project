### Temporal expressions

NEW in version 2
{: .label .label-green}

{: .def}
> Temporal markers are devices that refer to when an event referenced in the clause happened.

#### Description

Temporal expressions express the time of an action or event happened. Importantly, this should NOT be confused with `Text-sequencing` markers. While text-sequencing markers acts as signals to organize the argument, temporal markers are literally expressions of `TIME`. 

Typical ways that temporal expressions are used include:

- `When` clause to add information about the timing of an event relative to the other event.
- Time related expressions such as `on weekends`, `at 11 pm`, etc.

#### Examples

- **Eventually** participants began calling out terms as well. 
- I know that we're finishing **on Friday** in mainstream school.
- Scott first learned that he had an LD **while he was filling out forms for college admission**.
- In this article, **when we use the term letter–sound knowledge**, we refer broadly to all grapheme–phoneme correspondences.
- For example, **when we are assigned a new phone number**, we may treat each digit separately and need to write each of them down or rehearse them subvocally in order to remember them.


#### Distinguishing TEMPORAL from ENTERTAIN

Sometimes, we have instances where `ENTERTAIN` interpretation is more appropriate than `TEMPORAL`. An `ENTERTAIN` choice is appropriate where the idea presented in the relevant part of the text offers some conditions rather than literal time-related meaning.

- More comes later.....


#### Distinguishing from TEXT-SEQUENCING

When the temporal expression function as text organizer, rather than simply referring to when the event happened, then we should use `TEXT SEQUENCING` tag instead of `TEMPORAL`.

- **Finally (Text-sequencing)**, for the Farsi group, none of the 10 linguistic variables bore a strong relationship with comprehensibility. 
- Megan's intonation indicated that she was not convinced. **Finally (TEMPORAL)**, Emily (11) reminded the group that the task did not include identification of NPs, and so this was a side issue as far as she was concerned.
